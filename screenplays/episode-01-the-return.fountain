FADE IN:

INT. THE LIMINAL - CREW QUARTERS - DEEP SPACE

DARKNESS. Then--

The soft PING of a ship's system waking up. Status lights blink to life in sequence, casting blue-green shadows across a cramped bunk.

KAEL VASARO (mid-40s) lies on his back, eyes closed. His face is weathered but not hard--more tired than bitter. Salt-and-pepper stubble. The kind of man who stopped caring about appearances around the same time he stopped caring about most things.

He doesn't move. The ship HUM surrounds him like a blanket.

LIMINAL (V.O.)
(ship AI, female, flat)
Transit complete. Kepler Station approach confirmed. Docking window in forty-three minutes.

Kael's eyes open. He stares at the ceiling--metal panels covered in twenty years of modifications. Cable runs. Personal touches. A photograph tucked into a joint seam, too faded to read from here.

He exhales. Not a sigh--just breathing. The first breath of another day that doesn't require anything from him.

He sits up slowly. Every joint in his body protests. He ignores it.

The quarters are TIGHT. A bunk barely wide enough for his shoulders. Storage compartments built into every surface. A fold-down desk with a console. Everything within arm's reach.

This isn't a ship. It's a home. Twenty years of wear patterns. Twenty years of making this space HIS.

Kael swings his legs off the bunk. His bare feet touch the deck plating--cold metal, familiar.

He reaches for a COFFEE MAKER mounted to the wall. It's been repaired so many times the original parts are probably outnumbered. He hits a button. It GURGLES and HISSES, then produces something approximately like coffee.

He drinks it standing. Staring at nothing.

INT. THE LIMINAL - COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

Kael moves forward through the narrow corridor. The cockpit is small but functional--pilot's chair, nav console, wide viewport.

Through the glass: STARS. Endless. And in the distance, growing larger, the rotating ring of KEPLER STATION. Gray metal against black void. Running lights blinking. Ships dotting the approaches like fireflies.

Kael settles into the pilot's chair. It's molded to his body after two decades.

He runs through pre-dock procedures without looking. Fingers finding switches by muscle memory.

LIMINAL (V.O.)
Docking beacon acquired. Lane assignment: Berth 17-C.

KAEL
(flat)
Accepted.

His voice is rough from disuse. He doesn't talk much.

The station grows in the viewport. Home base. Or the closest thing to it.

EXT. KEPLER STATION - DOCKING ARM - LATER

The Liminal slides into her berth. DOCKING CLAMPS engage with a solid THUNK. Umbilicals extend and connect--power, data, atmo.

The ship settles. Goes quiet.

INT. THE LIMINAL - AIRLOCK - CONTINUOUS

Kael stands at the inner door, waiting for pressure equalization. He's dressed now--practical spacer clothes. Worn jacket, cargo pants, boots that have seen a thousand station decks. A SIDEARM on his hip, holstered but visible. Normal out here.

His DATA KEY hangs on a cord around his neck--disguised as a simple metal pendant. Unremarkable. Essential.

The airlock CYCLES. The outer door opens.

INT. KEPLER STATION - DOCK CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

Kael steps out into the station.

The difference is immediate. NOISE. MOVEMENT. LIFE.

The dock corridor stretches ahead--a wide thoroughfare of controlled chaos:

-- CARGO BOTS roll past, their chassis scratched and dented. Some move in formation. Others navigate solo, weaving around obstacles.

-- SHIPS of various sizes fill the visible berths. A battered freighter getting its hull patched. A sleek courier vessel with engine panels open. A salvage rig that looks like it was assembled from three different ships.

-- PEOPLE. Dock workers in coveralls. Pilots in flight suits. Merchants. Mechanics. Drifters. Everyone has somewhere to be.

Kael walks. Not fast, not slow. He moves through the crowd without touching anyone--a skill developed over years. His eyes track everything without focusing on anything.

A CLEANING BOT crosses his path, scrubbing a fuel stain from the deck. He steps around it without slowing.

MARKET STALLS line the corridor walls. Synthetic protein in various shapes. Hydroponic vegetables. Stimulants. Questionable electronics. A man selling "genuine Earth artifacts" that are obviously printed fakes.

The AIR smells like recycled atmo, machine oil, and something cooking with too much spice. The station's ventilation hums overhead, a constant bass note beneath the chaos.

Kael passes a NEWS DISPLAY mounted to a pillar. A talking head mouths silently--some political story. He doesn't look.

EXT. KEPLER STATION - REPAIR BAY 12 - CONTINUOUS

A workshop space open to the dock corridor. Tools hanging on pegboards. Ship components on workbenches. The organized chaos of people who know where everything is.

TOMAS (50s, barrel-chested, cybernetic arm replacement on his right side) is elbow-deep in an engine housing. His husband YUKI (50s, lean, patient face, graying temples) works at a diagnostic console nearby.

Kael approaches. Tomas looks up. His face splits into a grin.

TOMAS
Vasaro. You look like shit.

KAEL
Long haul.

Tomas wipes his hands on a rag--the organic hand, not the metal one.

TOMAS
Where from?

KAEL
Belt. The far side.

YUKI
(without looking up)
The Liminal holding up?

KAEL
Always does.

TOMAS
Got a coupling that'd fit your starboard thruster.

Kael raises an eyebrow slightly. Waiting.

TOMAS (CONT'D)
Fell off a transport. Legally.

KAEL
How much?

TOMAS
For you? Cost plus ten.

KAEL
I'll think about it.

YUKI
(still not looking up)
You always think about it. Then you buy it.

Kael almost smiles. ALMOST. The corner of his mouth twitches, nothing more.

TOMAS
You eating?

KAEL
Getting to it.

TOMAS
Ming's is good today. The noodles.

Kael nods. A minimal acknowledgment. This is the extent of his social interaction--brief, transactional, but not cold. There's familiarity here. The comfortable shorthand of people who've known each other for years without ever becoming friends.

He moves on.

EXT. KEPLER STATION - FOOD STALL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

A narrow passage lined with cooking stations. Steam and smoke. The SIZZLE of protein on hot metal. VENDORS calling out in multiple languages.

Kael stops at a stall run by an OLD WOMAN with cybernetic eyes. Her movements are precise despite her age. She's cooking something unidentifiable--meat, probably. It smells good enough.

OLD WOMAN
The usual?

Kael nods.

She works fast. Skewered protein, some kind of sauce, wrapped in synthetic bread. She hands it to him. He pays with a tap of his data key.

OLD WOMAN (CONT'D)
You're back soon.

KAEL
Needed supplies.

OLD WOMAN
Don't we all.

He takes his food. Eats it walking. The protein is chewy, overseasoned, exactly what he expected. It's fine. Fine is enough.

EXT. KEPLER STATION - OBSERVATION DECK - CONTINUOUS

A small platform with a viewport looking out at the station's exterior. Ships coming and going. The distant glow of the belt.

Kael stands here, finishing his food. Watching.

A FAMILY passes behind him. Two adults, two kids. The kids are arguing about something. The parents look tired. Normal life. Normal problems.

Kael watches them go. His face reveals nothing.

A SECURITY BOT rolls past, SCANNING faces. Its red eye lingers on Kael for a moment, then moves on. Nothing flagged. He's not interesting.

He finishes eating. Balls up the wrapper. Drops it in a recycler.

Heads back to his ship.

INT. THE LIMINAL - COCKPIT - LATER

Kael settles back into his chair. The familiar embrace.

He pulls up the JOB BOARD on his console. Listings scroll past:

-- "Cargo run to Titan Station - 4 weeks - Standard rate"
-- "Salvage claim dispute escort - Combat certification required"
-- "Medical supplies to Belt Colony 7 - Priority transit"
-- "Data courier - Origin: Earth - Destination: Classified"

He scrolls. Stops on one.

LISTING (ON SCREEN)
"Mineral samples - Kepler to Ceres Outpost. 3 weeks transit. Rate: 12,000 credits. No questions."

Good enough. He accepts it. The confirmation pings.

LIMINAL (V.O.)
Route calculation initiated. Estimated transit time: 19 days, 4 hours.

KAEL
Start it.

While the nav computer works, he pulls up a secondary display. Tabs through options. Lands on: NEWS FEED.

He doesn't know why he does it. He never does. Habit, maybe. Or masochism.

INT. THE LIMINAL - COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

The feed fills his screen. Talking heads. Graphics. The endless churn.

HEADLINE CRAWLER: "LOCKE CAMPAIGN IN FREEFALL AFTER FUNDING REVELATIONS"

Kael's eyes flick to the story. A VIDEO plays:

VANESSA LOCKE (50s, composed, professional) stands at a podium. She looks tired. The kind of tired that comes from defending yourself against attacks from every direction.

NEWS ANCHOR (V.O.)
(from the feed)
Independent candidate Vanessa Locke suspended her campaign today amid escalating allegations of financial impropriety--

Kael taps to another channel. Different talking head. Different angle.

NEWS ANCHOR 2 (V.O.)
--the progressive coalition has called for a full investigation into what they're calling "a shocking betrayal of stated values"--

Another tap. Another channel.

NEWS ANCHOR 3 (V.O.)
--conservative groups are demanding accountability, citing Locke's alleged ties to globalist banking interests--

Kael's jaw tightens slightly. He taps through more feeds:

PROGRESSIVE FEED: "LOCKE EXPOSED: Dark money ties reveal centrist fraud"

CONSERVATIVE FEED: "LOCKE UNMASKED: Woke agenda funded by offshore elites"

INDEPENDENT FEED: "ATTACK COORDINATION: Same story, opposite spins, simultaneous release"

Same footage. Same woman. Different villains depending on who's watching.

Kael stares at the screen. His expression doesn't change, but something behind his eyes does. A familiar disappointment. The bone-deep weariness of someone who expected nothing and is still let down.

KAEL
(barely audible)
Yeah.

He closes the political feeds. Scrolls past them. Station updates. Shipping manifests. Celebrity gossip. An ad for memory enhancement implants.

The usual churn.

Then--

He stops scrolling.

HEADLINE (ON SCREEN)
"Federal Auditor Dies in New Francisco Apartment Fire. Twin Sister Survived."

Kael stares at it.

His finger hovers over the screen.

CLOSE ON his eyes. Something flickering. The smallest crack in the wall.

He taps the story.

INT. THE LIMINAL - COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

The article expands:

TEXT (ON SCREEN)
"...Federal Accounts Division employee found deceased following residential fire in the Tenderloin district of New Francisco. The cause of the blaze remains under investigation. The victim's twin sister, who was present at the time, escaped with minor injuries and is cooperating with authorities..."

No name in the headline. "Federal Accounts Division." "New Francisco district." "Twin sister."

Kael's face is very still.

KAEL
(quiet)
No.

He searches. Types quickly: "Federal Accounts Division New Francisco employees."

Results populate. He scrolls through faces, names, departments.

Stops on one.

MARCUS OYELARAN. The photo shows a man about Kael's age. Thoughtful eyes. The kind of face that doesn't give much away. The bio lists: "Senior Auditor, Federal Accounts Division, Western Region."

Kael stares at the photo.

FLASHBACK - QUICK CUTS:

-- TEXT on a screen: "You awake?" "Yeah. Can't sleep." "Same. What time is it there?" "Late."

-- A voice message, MARCUS's voice: "Called about the thing. They're stonewalling. Surprise surprise."

-- Another text exchange: "You ever think about just... leaving?" "Every day." "I actually did it." "I know. Lucky bastard."

BACK TO PRESENT:

Kael's hand is trembling slightly. He steadies it.

LIMINAL (V.O.)
Route calculation complete. Ready to depart.

Kael doesn't move.

He reads the article again. "Apartment fire." "Cause under investigation." "Twin sister survived."

His jaw works. Something building behind the stillness.

LIMINAL (V.O.)
Awaiting departure confirmation.

Kael reaches for the console. His finger hovers over the "Confirm" button.

He doesn't press it.

Instead, he opens the nav system. Cancels the job.

LIMINAL (V.O.)
Job canceled. Penalty fee applied to account.

Kael ignores it. He's already typing a new destination.

NEW DESTINATION (ON SCREEN): EARTH - NEW FRANCISCO APPROACH - PRIORITY TRANSIT

LIMINAL (V.O.)
Warning: Earth transit requires current documentation and landing permits. Your credentials have not been updated in--

KAEL
Override.

LIMINAL (V.O.)
Calculating priority route. Estimated transit: 11 days.

KAEL
Do it.

He hits the release sequence. The docking clamps DISENGAGE.

EXT. KEPLER STATION - DOCKING ARM - CONTINUOUS

The Liminal pulls away from the berth. Umbilicals disconnect and retract. The ship pivots, nose orienting toward the void.

INT. THE LIMINAL - COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

Kael watches the station shrink in the viewport.

His face is stone. But his eyes--his eyes are burning.

KAEL
(quiet)
What did you find, Marcus?

EXT. SPACE - CONTINUOUS

The Liminal accelerates. Her engines flare bright, then brighter.

Kepler Station dwindles behind her. The ship becomes a point of light, streaking toward the distant inner system.

Toward Earth.

Toward something Kael swore he'd never face again.

TITLE CARD:

T E T H E R

The title BURNS IN, then FADES slowly as the ship's light disappears into the black.

FADE TO:

INT. THE LIMINAL - COCKPIT - LATER (TRAVEL MONTAGE)

SERIES OF SHOTS showing the passage of time:

-- Kael at the nav console, checking trajectory.

-- Kael eating alone, staring at the viewport.

-- The stars shifting as the ship changes orientation.

-- Kael in his bunk, eyes open, unable to sleep.

-- The coffee maker producing its approximation of coffee.

-- Kael exercising in the cargo bay--pull-ups on an overhead beam. Mechanical. Routine.

-- Earth growing larger in the viewport. Day by day.

-- Kael cleaning his sidearm. Checking the chamber. Holstering it.

-- The blue marble of Earth, now filling half the viewport. Clouds. Continents. City lights on the night side like a disease spreading across the surface.

LIMINAL (V.O.)
Approaching Earth orbital space. Traffic control handoff initiated.

Kael straightens in his chair.

LIMINAL (V.O.)
Be advised: Documentation check required at orbital checkpoint.

KAEL
What's our status?

LIMINAL (V.O.)
Your credentials show last planetary landing: twenty years, three months, seven days ago. System flagged for manual review.

KAEL
And?

LIMINAL (V.O.)
Review completed. Landing permit approved. Note attached: "Welcome back."

Kael says nothing. Welcome back. The two least appropriate words in any language.

EXT. EARTH ORBIT - CONTINUOUS

The Liminal slides past a massive ORBITAL STATION--a hub of arriving and departing traffic. Cargo vessels. Passenger transports. Luxury shuttles. Military corvettes on patrol.

The ship is SCANNED by multiple sensor arrays. Running lights flash. Transponder exchanges happen automatically.

And then--the planet.

Earth hangs in the viewport. Blue and white and green and brown. Beautiful from here. Almost peaceful.

Kael stares at it.

KAEL
(quiet, to himself)
There it is.

The Liminal angles toward the atmosphere.

EXT. EARTH - ATMOSPHERIC ENTRY - CONTINUOUS

The ship SHUDDERS as it hits the upper atmosphere. Friction paints the hull in orange and red. The ROAR of entry builds, peaks, then fades as the vessel drops into thicker air.

Below: the North American western coast. The sprawl of the megalopolis that used to be separate cities--now one continuous urban mass from old Seattle to old San Diego.

NEW FRANCISCO rises from the heart of it. Towers reaching toward orbit. A forest of metal and glass and holographic advertisements. Flying vehicles streaming between the spires like blood cells in veins.

INT. THE LIMINAL - COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

Kael grips the flight controls. The ship handles differently in atmosphere--heavier, more resistant.

Outside the viewport: the city ERUPTS around him.

HOLOGRAPHIC ADS assault from every angle:

-- "SYNTHEX: Because your best self isn't born, it's built!"

-- "LUMINA SOCIAL: 47 billion connections and counting!"

-- "VOTE MARTINEZ: The strength to say NO to extremism!"

-- "VOTE CHEN: Finally, a leader who fights for YOU!"

The NOISE is overwhelming. His comm system picks up ambient traffic:

TRAFFIC CONTROL (V.O.)
(overlapping)
--vector three-seven, adjust heading--

ADVERTISEMENT (V.O.)
(bleeding through)
--limited time offer, neural bandwidth upgrade--

PILOT 2 (V.O.)
--fucking traffic, every goddamn day--

ADVERTISEMENT 2 (V.O.)
--are you living your authentic life? Take the Authenticity Index--

Kael mutes everything he can. The silence is only partial. Some signals force their way through.

LIMINAL (V.O.)
Assigned landing zone: Lower District Temporary Berth 7. Duration limited to 72 hours without extension fee.

KAEL
Fine.

He guides the ship down, down, down--past the gleaming upper levels, past the mid-tier residential towers, into the LOWER DISTRICTS where the buildings are older, denser, more worn.

The light changes. Less holographic assault. More neon and LED. Older technology. Cheaper real estate.

Home. Or what passes for it.

EXT. NEW FRANCISCO - LOWER DISTRICT - LANDING PAD - DUSK

The Liminal touches down on a scarred landing pad. The surrounding area is a maze of apartment blocks, commercial structures, and infrastructure that was state-of-the-art two decades ago.

GROUND-LEVEL BOTS scurry past--cleaning units, security drones, delivery machines. People move between them, heads down, eyes on personal displays projected from wrist units or glasses.

No one looks at the ship. No one looks at anything.

INT. THE LIMINAL - AIRLOCK - CONTINUOUS

Kael stands at the door. Ready to step out.

He hesitates.

LIMINAL (V.O.)
External conditions: Breathable atmosphere with elevated particulate levels. Temperature: 23 Celsius. Humidity: 68%. Air quality advisory in effect.

He doesn't care about any of that. It's not the air that makes him hesitate.

He touches the data key around his neck. Checks his sidearm. Takes a breath.

Opens the door.

EXT. NEW FRANCISCO - LOWER DISTRICT - LANDING PAD - CONTINUOUS

Kael steps out.

The ASSAULT is immediate.

SOUND: Traffic. Voices. Music bleeding from storefronts. Advertisements. Sirens in the distance. The hum of a thousand machines. The never-ending PULSE of a city that never stops.

SMELL: Exhaust. Synthetic food. Rain on hot pavement. A chemical sweetness that might be perfume or might be pollution.

SIGHT: People EVERYWHERE. Packed onto sidewalks. Spilling out of buildings. Moving in streams and eddies around obstacles. All of them looking at screens. All of them somewhere else.

Kael stands very still.

A PEDESTRIAN bumps into him, doesn't apologize, keeps walking, eyes never leaving their wrist display.

Another pedestrian. Another.

Kael starts walking. His body language is WRONG here. Too much space around his movements. Too much awareness of his surroundings. He looks like what he is--an outsider.

A BEGGAR reaches toward him from a doorway. Kael sidesteps without acknowledgment. The beggar doesn't seem to notice.

HOLOGRAPHIC BILLBOARDS flash overhead:

-- A WOMAN crying into the camera: "They said I could trust them! Don't make my mistake! Use TrustVer for all your--"

-- A POLITICIAN with impossibly white teeth: "The choice is clear. Either you're with progress, or you're--"

-- An INFLUENCER posing with a product: "Thirty million followers can't be wrong! I lost forty pounds with--"

Kael walks faster.

He passes a STREET PREACHER on a corner, shouting into the void:

STREET PREACHER
--the algorithm knows! It sees your sins! Every click, every second of attention, it KNOWS--

Nobody's listening. Bots clean around his feet without slowing.

Kael turns down a side street. Narrower. Darker. The buildings press closer. Fire escapes zigzag overhead. LAUNDRY hangs from windows. The first signs of actual human habitation.

He checks his wrist unit. A MAP displays. Destination highlighted.

KAEL
(quiet)
Three more blocks.

He keeps moving.

EXT. NEW FRANCISCO - TENDERLOIN DISTRICT - MARCUS'S BUILDING - NIGHT

The address.

A residential tower, maybe fifteen stories. Old but maintained. The kind of place working people live--too poor to leave, too stable to fall further.

Kael stands across the street, looking up.

THIRD FLOOR. The window of Marcus's unit is BLACKENED. Scorch marks spread up the exterior like fingers reaching toward the sky. A section of wall is MISSING--exposed framework, charred insulation.

The surrounding windows are intact. Other units undamaged. The fire was contained. Or targeted.

CAUTION TAPE hangs from the building entrance. Yellow. Official. But one strip has been CUT--recently, from the clean edge.

Someone's been here.

Kael checks his surroundings. The street is sparse--a few pedestrians, none paying attention. A FOOD VENDOR packing up for the night. A DRONE passing overhead, sweeping the area with a spotlight before moving on.

He crosses the street.

INT. MARCUS'S BUILDING - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

The lobby is small and worn. A SECURITY DESK sits empty--the screen showing a maintenance notice. "Guard station unstaffed during off-hours. All visitors must register via mobile app."

Kael doesn't register. He walks past, toward the elevators.

One elevator is OUT OF SERVICE--taped off. The other is working. He takes it.

INT. MARCUS'S BUILDING - ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

Kael stands alone as the car rises. His reflection in the polished metal door--a stranger in a strange land.

The elevator PINGS. Third floor.

INT. MARCUS'S BUILDING - THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

The doors open. The SMELL hits first.

Burnt plastic. Charred wood. The lingering chemical bite of fire suppressant. Under it all, something organic. Something wrong.

Kael steps out.

The hallway is dimly lit--half the fixtures dead, casualties of the fire. SOOT stains the walls near Marcus's unit. The carpet is discolored, water-damaged.

Marcus's door is at the end.

It's OPEN. The frame warped, the lock mechanism melted into uselessness. More caution tape--cut, hanging loose.

Kael draws his sidearm. Moves quietly.

He reaches the doorway. Listens.

VOICES inside. Low. Professional.

VOICE 1 (O.S.)
(filtered through tactical mask)
Negative on the desk. Already cleared.

VOICE 2 (O.S.)
Check the vents. These places always have dead space.

Kael edges closer. Looks through the gap.

INT. MARCUS'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

The apartment is DESTROYED. Fire damage everywhere--walls black, furniture melted or collapsed, ceiling panels hanging loose. Water damage has made the floor treacherous.

TWO FIGURES move through the wreckage. They wear TACTICAL GEAR--black, armored, professional. Not police. Not official. PRIVATE CONTRACTORS. Their movements are efficient, coordinated. Military training.

They're SEARCHING. One pulls at a vent cover. The other sweeps a handheld scanner over the remains of what was once a bookshelf.

CONTRACTOR 1 is taller, leaner. CONTRACTOR 2 is broader, moves with a slight limp.

On the floor around them: EVIDENCE BAGS. They're collecting things. Or looking for something specific.

Kael watches. His mind races.

The contractors are thorough but frustrated. They haven't found what they're looking for.

Kael's eyes scan the room. The layout is visible despite the damage--living area, kitchenette, doorway to what must have been a bedroom. Personal effects reduced to ash and fragments.

Then he sees it.

On a WARPED SHELF near where a bathroom once was--half-melted, discolored, but intact--a small PLASTIC CASE. Rectangular. Hinged.

A contact lens holder.

FLASHBACK - QUICK:

MARCUS'S VOICE (V.O.)
(from an old message)
Finally got the new prescription. Can't believe you tried them and gave up after one day. Weak.

BACK TO PRESENT:

Kael's jaw tightens. Marcus wore contacts. Kael hated them. A small detail from a years-old conversation.

That case isn't holding lenses.

Contractor 2 turns. His scanner sweeps toward Kael's position.

CONTRACTOR 2
Hold.

He raises his weapon. Points it directly at the doorway.

CONTRACTOR 2 (CONT'D)
We've got company.

Time slows.

Kael MOVES.

INT. MARCUS'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS - ACTION SEQUENCE

GUNFIRE ERUPTS.

Kael dives RIGHT as Contractor 2's first shot SPLINTERS the door frame where his head was. He hits the floor, rolls behind the remains of a collapsed couch.

CONTRACTOR 1 opens fire--suppressed automatic weapon, professional groupings. Rounds PUNCH through the couch material, narrowly missing Kael.

Kael returns fire--two controlled shots. Contractor 1 is CLIPPED in the shoulder, staggers back but stays up. Body armor.

CONTRACTOR 2
(into comm)
Contact engaged. Third floor. Single hostile.

Kael is outgunned. He knows it. Two on one, better equipped, body armor.

He needs that case.

He VAULTS over the couch, sprinting low across the burned-out room. Rounds CRACK past him. One grazes his jacket sleeve.

Contractor 1 is tracking him, adjusting aim--

Kael THROWS a piece of debris. It catches Contractor 1 in the visor--not damaging, but disorienting for a half-second.

That's enough.

Kael reaches the shelf. GRABS the contact lens case. Shoves it in his pocket.

CONTRACTOR 2
He's got it! STOP HIM!

Kael spins. The bathroom--what's left of it--has a VENT ACCESS near the ceiling. He's already moving.

He LEAPS, catches the edge of the vent, PULLS himself up as gunfire SHREDS the wall below him.

INT. MARCUS'S BUILDING - VENTILATION SHAFT - CONTINUOUS

Kael crawls. Fast. The space is tight--barely wide enough for his shoulders. The metal groans under his weight.

Behind him, SHOUTING. The contractors trying to follow or cut him off.

CONTRACTOR 1 (O.S.)
(muffled)
Third floor vents connect to the stairwell!

Kael reaches a junction. Chooses left. Crawls faster.

The shaft ENDS at another vent cover. He can see through the slats--a HALLWAY. Different floor. Maybe second.

He KICKS the cover out. Drops through.

INT. MARCUS'S BUILDING - SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Kael lands hard, rolls, comes up running.

The hallway is residential--doors on both sides. A few are OPEN, residents peering out at the noise. An OLD MAN in a bathrobe. A YOUNG WOMAN with a child on her hip.

KAEL
(as he runs)
Get inside. Lock your doors.

They stare. He's gone before they can respond.

STAIRWELL. He hits the door, takes the stairs UP--not down. Counterintuitive. Better.

INT. MARCUS'S BUILDING - STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

Kael climbs. His breath is controlled--spacer fitness, years of maintaining himself in low gravity. His legs burn but they don't fail him.

BELOW: boots on metal. The contractors are in the stairwell.

CONTRACTOR 2 (O.S.)
He's going up!

CONTRACTOR 1 (O.S.)
Cut him off on five!

Kael reaches the FOURTH FLOOR door. Opens it. Closes it loudly.

But doesn't go through. He waits.

FOOTSTEPS pound past, going up.

He slips back into the stairwell. Goes DOWN.

INT. MARCUS'S BUILDING - FIRST FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

Kael emerges into a service corridor. Basement access, utility rooms, a back exit.

He takes the EXIT.

EXT. MARCUS'S BUILDING - ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

The alley is narrow, dark, lined with refuse processors and recycling units. The smell is overwhelming.

Kael moves fast but not running. Running draws attention. He walks with purpose, keeping to shadows.

He reaches the street. Turns right. Away from the building.

SIRENS begin in the distance. Getting closer.

He walks faster.

EXT. NEW FRANCISCO - TENDERLOIN DISTRICT - SIDE STREETS - CONTINUOUS

Kael navigates the maze of side streets. Taking turns at random. Putting distance between himself and the scene.

The streets are emptier here--late night, residential, working-class neighborhood asleep or pretending to be. The occasional drone passes overhead. He avoids their lights.

A CORNER. He turns it, looking back over his shoulder--

COLLISION.

His shoulder CONNECTS with someone's face. Hard.

A WOMAN. She goes DOWN, hitting the pavement. Doesn't get up.

Kael stumbles, catches himself. Instinct screams RUN.

He takes three steps.

Stops.

Looks back.

She's on the ground. Not moving. The streetlight here is flickering, half-dead.

Kael listens. The sirens are still distant. No immediate pursuit.

He goes back.

She's BREATHING. Just knocked out. Her face is turned away, hair covering her features.

He can't leave her here. If they find her, they'll question her. What did she see?

He grabs her under the arms. DRAGS her toward a doorway--an alcove, recessed, dark.

KAEL
(muttering)
Come on...

He props her against the wall. She slumps but stays sitting. Still unconscious.

His hands check her for injuries. No blood. No obvious breaks. Just knocked cold.

He needs to see her face. Make sure she's stable. Make sure she isn't--

He pulls out his comm unit. Activates the light.

And FREEZES.

CLOSE ON: ELARA OYELARAN'S FACE

The same face as Marcus. Feminine. Softer. But the bone structure is identical. The eyes--closed now--are the same shape, the same set.

Marcus's twin sister.

FLASHBACK - QUICK:

NEWS HEADLINE (V.O.)
"...Twin sister survived..."

BACK TO PRESENT:

Kael stares at her. His face cycles through something he hasn't felt in years--shock, recognition, a terrible understanding.

KAEL
(barely a whisper)
Elara.

She was coming here too. Looking for answers. Just like him.

He ran straight into her.

He closes his eyes. Opens them. This isn't coincidence. It can't be.

SIRENS. Closer now. Much closer.

Kael looks up. Through the alcove opening, he can see the street beginning to FILL.

Not just police.

PARAMILITARY VEHICLES roll past. Heavy. Armored. TROOPS in tactical gear dismount and spread out.

This isn't a response. It's a SWEEP.

EXT. NEW FRANCISCO - TENDERLOIN DISTRICT - STREET - CONTINUOUS

The crackdown begins.

SOLDIERS move door to door. POUNDING. DEMANDING. Residents dragged into the street for processing.

An OLD MAN protests. He's STRUCK with a baton, forced to his knees.

A FAMILY emerges, hands raised. CHILDREN CRYING. They're pushed against a wall, scanned, questioned.

DRONES flood the airspace, spotlights sweeping the streets, scanning every face.

Shouts. Screams. The sounds of a neighborhood being torn apart.

INT. ALCOVE - CONTINUOUS

Kael watches through a gap in the doorway.

His face is stone. But something flickers in his eyes--something old, something he thought he'd buried.

This is the Earth he left.

This is what it became.

ELARA stirs.

Kael turns. She's coming to. Her eyes flutter, trying to focus. Her hand goes to her head--pain.

ELARA
(groggy)
Wh... what...

Her eyes find Kael. A stranger. Looming over her in the dark.

Her face cycles through confusion, fear, rising panic.

She opens her mouth--

KAEL
(low, urgent)
Don't.

Elara hesitates. The fear is still there, but there's something in his voice--not a threat, a warning.

KAEL (CONT'D)
If you scream, they'll find us. Both of us.

She's still groggy. Processing. Her eyes dart to the gap in the doorway. She sees what's happening outside. The troops. The civilians.

ELARA
(hoarse)
Who... who are you?

Kael doesn't answer immediately. How do you explain this?

A SPOTLIGHT sweeps past. They both freeze. It passes.

KAEL
I knew Marcus.

Elara's face changes. The name hits her like a physical blow.

ELARA
(barely audible)
Marcus.

KAEL
I came when I heard. I'm not here to hurt you.

She's shaking now. Adrenaline, fear, grief--all catching up at once.

ELARA
They killed him. They--

KAEL
(cutting her off)
Not now. We need to move.

ELARA
I can't--

KAEL
You can. You have to.

He offers his hand. She looks at it. At him. At the chaos outside.

She doesn't trust him. She has no reason to.

But she takes his hand.

EXT. NEW FRANCISCO - TENDERLOIN DISTRICT - SIDE STREETS - CONTINUOUS

Kael and Elara move through the darkness. He leads. She follows, unsteady but keeping up.

He navigates by instinct--avoiding light, choosing the tightest passages, the deepest shadows.

They pass RESIDENTS huddled in doorways, hiding. An OLD COUPLE clutching each other. CHILDREN with terrified eyes.

The crackdown continues in the background. Shouts. Screams. The crash of doors being broken.

Kael and Elara keep moving.

A PATROL crosses an intersection ahead. They press against a wall, waiting.

Elara's breathing is ragged. Kael puts a hand on her arm--steadying, not grabbing.

KAEL
(barely audible)
Slow breaths.

She tries. It helps.

The patrol passes.

They move again.

EXT. NEW FRANCISCO - LOWER DISTRICT - EDGE OF TENDERLOIN - LATER

The chaos fades behind them. Different neighborhood. Still poor, still dense, but not currently being torn apart.

Kael stops in the shadow of a derelict building. Checks their surroundings. Clear--for now.

ELARA
(panting)
Where... where are we going?

KAEL
My ship. It's the only safe place I know.

ELARA
A ship?

KAEL
I came from the outer system. Belt stations.

She stares at him. This man who appeared out of nowhere. Who knew her brother. Who's now trying to save her.

ELARA
Who are you?

KAEL
(pause)
Kael. Kael Vasaro.

Recognition flickers in her eyes.

ELARA
Marcus mentioned you. His friend from... from out there.

Friend. The word hangs between them.

KAEL
(quiet)
He was the only one.

Elara's eyes fill. She blinks it back. There's no time for grief. Not yet.

ELARA
They killed him. Those men--

KAEL
I know.

ELARA
They were at his apartment. When I got there, I saw them going in. I waited, I thought... I thought they'd leave and I could...

KAEL
Look for what he left behind.

She nods.

KAEL (CONT'D)
He did leave something.

He pulls out the CONTACT LENS CASE. Half-melted, discolored. She stares at it.

ELARA
His... his key?

KAEL
Everything. His work. His investigation. Whatever he found.

Elara's hand shakes as she reaches for it. Kael lets her hold it. She turns it over in her fingers, seeing her brother in this small, damaged object.

ELARA
(breaking)
He knew. He knew they would come for him.

KAEL
He was careful. He hid it.

ELARA
Not careful enough.

A DRONE passes overhead. They both go still. It continues on.

KAEL
We need to keep moving.

Elara hands the case back. He pockets it.

ELARA
Your ship. How far?

KAEL
Twenty minutes. If we're smart.

She nods. Sets her jaw.

ELARA
Then let's be smart.

They move.

EXT. NEW FRANCISCO - LOWER DISTRICT - STREETS - LATER

A MONTAGE of careful navigation:

-- Kael and Elara ducking into an alley as a patrol vehicle passes.

-- Crossing a pedestrian bridge, heads down, blending with late-night foot traffic.

-- Waiting in a doorway as a drone sweeps the street.

-- Moving through a market area that's closed for the night, stalls shuttered, bots on standby.

-- Elara stumbling, Kael catching her, steadying her, moving on.

The tension never breaks. Every corner could be the wrong one.

EXT. NEW FRANCISCO - LOWER DISTRICT - LANDING PAD - NIGHT

They reach the landing pad.

The Liminal sits where Kael left her. Battered, functional, SAFE.

KAEL
There.

Elara stares at the ship. It's not what she expected. Small. Old. Worn.

ELARA
That's your home?

KAEL
For twenty years.

They cross the open space quickly. Kael inputs his authorization. The airlock opens.

They step inside.

INT. THE LIMINAL - AIRLOCK - CONTINUOUS

The door seals behind them. The outside noise vanishes.

SILENCE.

Elara sags against the wall. The adrenaline crash hits her hard. She's shaking.

Kael checks the external feeds on a wall panel. No immediate pursuit. No one followed them here--yet.

KAEL
We're clear. For now.

ELARA
(barely holding it together)
For now.

She slides down the wall. Sits on the deck. Pulls her knees to her chest.

Kael watches her. He doesn't know what to say. Comfort isn't in his vocabulary.

He does what he knows how to do. He moves.

KAEL
I'll get us off the ground.

He heads for the cockpit.

INT. THE LIMINAL - COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

Kael drops into the pilot's seat. Starts pre-flight.

LIMINAL (V.O.)
Systems online. Duration of stay: 6 hours, 14 minutes. Departure under limit. No extension fee.

KAEL
Plot a course. Anywhere that isn't here. Low traffic.

LIMINAL (V.O.)
Lunar orbit has available holding positions. Transit time: 4 hours, 22 minutes.

KAEL
Do it.

The engines begin to HUM. The deck vibrates.

Through the viewport, the landing pad drops away.

EXT. NEW FRANCISCO - LOWER DISTRICT - CONTINUOUS

The Liminal rises. Her running lights blink against the urban darkness.

She climbs, leaving the maze of buildings behind.

Below, the city continues its business. The crackdown in the Tenderloin is just one more event in a city of millions. Tomorrow, it won't even make the news.

The ship climbs higher. Past the mid-tier. Past the gleaming towers.

Into the sky.

INT. THE LIMINAL - CREW QUARTERS - LATER

Elara sits on Kael's bunk. The only seat in the quarters. She looks small in the cramped space.

Kael leans against the opposite wall, arms crossed. He's given her water. She hasn't touched it.

The ship is in transit now. The danger is past--for the moment.

SILENCE stretches between them.

ELARA
(quiet)
He talked about you. Not often. But sometimes.

Kael doesn't respond.

ELARA (CONT'D)
He said you were the only person who understood him.

KAEL
(flat)
We understood we were both broken. That was enough.

ELARA
He wasn't broken.

KAEL
(pause)
No. He wasn't.

Elara looks at him. Really looks.

ELARA
Why did you come back?

KAEL
I saw the news. Apartment fire. Twin sister survived. I knew it was him.

ELARA
That's not what I asked.

Kael is quiet for a long moment.

KAEL
He was the only one who didn't ask me to be anything. Twenty years of messages. He never once asked me to come home.

ELARA
So why now?

KAEL
Because he can't ask anymore.

Elara absorbs this. The grief is there, raw and new, but she's holding it.

ELARA
What was he investigating?

KAEL
I don't know yet. But they wanted it bad enough to kill him for it.

He pulls out the contact lens case. Sets it on the fold-down desk.

KAEL (CONT'D)
This is his data key. Everything he knew is accessible through it. His files. His work. His investigation.

ELARA
(looking at the case)
Can you access it?

KAEL
I'll need secure hardware. Not here. Not now.

ELARA
Where?

KAEL
I know some people. Off Earth. They can help.

Elara nods slowly. She's running on fumes, but her mind is working.

ELARA
Those men. The ones at the apartment. They weren't police.

KAEL
Private contractors. Paramilitary.

ELARA
Working for who?

KAEL
That's what we're going to find out.

"We." The word hangs in the air. Kael didn't plan to say it. Didn't plan any of this.

Elara catches it.

ELARA
We?

KAEL
(after a pause)
You have anywhere else to go?

She doesn't answer. They both know.

KAEL (CONT'D)
Then you're with me. Until we figure this out.

ELARA
And then?

KAEL
Then we make them pay.

It's not a promise. It's not a threat. It's just a statement of fact, delivered flat.

Elara looks at him--this closed-off man who came back to a world he hated for a friend he couldn't save. There's nothing warm in his face. Nothing inviting.

But there's something else. Something steady.

ELARA
(quiet)
Okay.

She reaches for the water. Drinks.

Kael watches her for a moment. Then turns away.

KAEL
There's food in the galley. Basic stuff. You should eat.

ELARA
I'm not hungry.

KAEL
Eat anyway. We've got a long road.

He heads toward the cockpit. Stops at the door.

KAEL (CONT'D)
Get some rest. The bunk's yours.

ELARA
Where will you sleep?

KAEL
I won't.

He leaves.

INT. THE LIMINAL - COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

Kael settles into his chair. The stars wheel past the viewport. Earth shrinks behind them--a blue marble receding into the black.

He sits alone. Staring at nothing.

His hand touches his pocket. The data key.

KAEL
(quiet)
What did you find, Marcus?

No answer. Just the hum of the ship.

He pulls up a display. Marcus's face looks back at him--the same photo from the employee database.

They were never in the same room. Never shook hands. Never shared a meal.

And now they never will.

Kael stares at the face.

KAEL (CONT'D)
(barely audible)
I'll finish it. Whatever it takes.

He closes the display.

The ship flies on.

INT. THE LIMINAL - CREW QUARTERS - LATER

Elara lies on the bunk. Her eyes are closed, but she's not sleeping. Her hand rests on her chest, rising and falling with each breath.

Her face is wet. Silent tears.

She doesn't know this ship. This man. This path.

But her brother is dead, and someone killed him, and this stranger might be the only one who cares enough to do something about it.

She cries without sound until sleep finally takes her.

INT. THE LIMINAL - COCKPIT - LATER

Kael sits in darkness. The console glow the only light.

Outside, the void stretches infinite.

Earth is a distant point now. Getting smaller.

He should feel relief. He's leaving again. Running again.

He doesn't feel anything.

That's the problem.

That's always been the problem.

LIMINAL (V.O.)
Approaching lunar orbital insertion. Holding pattern confirmed.

KAEL
(automatic)
Acknowledged.

He leans back. Closes his eyes.

When he opens them again, he sees Marcus's face in the reflection on the viewport. Imagination. Memory.

MARCUS (V.O.)
(from an old message, memory)
You ever think maybe you're hiding out there?

KAEL
(quiet, to the memory)
Every day.

MARCUS (V.O.)
(memory)
Maybe that's okay. Maybe some people aren't meant to be around other people.

KAEL
(quiet)
Maybe.

MARCUS (V.O.)
(memory)
Or maybe you're just scared.

Kael doesn't answer that one.

The memory fades. The reflection is just his face again.

Tired. Weathered. Alone.

He touches the contact lens case one more time.

EXT. SPACE - THE LIMINAL - CONTINUOUS

The ship drifts in lunar orbit. The Moon fills half the frame--cratered, barren, ancient. Earth beyond it, small and distant.

The Liminal hangs in the void. A speck against the infinite.

Inside, two people who've lost the same man. One who lost him to death. One who lost him years before, to distance and silence.

They're connected now. Tethered by grief and circumstance.

The stars turn slowly overhead.

FADE TO:

INT. THE LIMINAL - CREW QUARTERS - LATER

Morning. Or what passes for it.

Elara wakes to unfamiliar surroundings. For a moment, panic--

Then she remembers.

She sits up slowly. Her head hurts. Her body aches.

The ship hums around her. Constant, indifferent.

On the fold-down desk: a meal pack, water, a small medical kit.

She didn't see Kael put them there.

She picks up the meal pack. Looks at it.

Forces herself to eat.

INT. THE LIMINAL - COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

Kael hasn't moved. He might have dozed; it's hard to tell.

FOOTSTEPS behind him. Elara appears in the doorway, holding the meal pack.

ELARA
How long was I out?

KAEL
Six hours.

ELARA
Did you sleep?

KAEL
Told you I wouldn't.

She moves into the cockpit. Sits in the copilot seat--unused, dusty.

Through the viewport: the Moon. Earth. The void.

ELARA
It's beautiful.

KAEL
It's empty.

ELARA
Maybe that's why it's beautiful.

Kael glances at her. A flicker of something--recognition, maybe. She sounds like Marcus.

ELARA (CONT'D)
What happens now?

KAEL
We access the key. Find out what Marcus knew.

ELARA
And then?

KAEL
Depends on what we find.

ELARA
You really don't know? What he was working on?

KAEL
We talked about everything except work. That was the point.

Elara absorbs this.

ELARA
(quiet)
He was always like that. Careful about what he shared. Protective.

KAEL
He didn't want to put anyone at risk.

ELARA
Including himself.

They sit in silence. The Moon rotates slowly outside.

ELARA (CONT'D)
When I saw the fire... I knew. I knew it wasn't an accident.

KAEL
What did you see?

ELARA
Nothing. That's how I knew. It was too clean. The fire, the response, the coverage. It was like... like someone had planned how it would be reported before it happened.

KAEL
They probably did.

ELARA
(looking at him)
You believe me.

KAEL
I've seen what powerful people do when they're threatened.

ELARA
Out there? In space?

KAEL
(flat)
People are the same everywhere. Money, power, fear. The address changes. The math doesn't.

Elara finishes her meal pack. Sets it aside.

ELARA
Marcus always said you were cynical.

KAEL
Marcus was generous.

ELARA
He also said you were probably right.

Almost a smile from Kael. Almost.

LIMINAL (V.O.)
Priority transmission incoming. Kepler Station origin.

Kael straightens. Pulls up the comm system.

KAEL
Put it through.

A VOICE crackles through--TOMAS.

TOMAS (V.O.)
Vasaro. What the hell did you do?

KAEL
News travels fast.

TOMAS (V.O.)
News hell. I got two agency types at my shop asking about your ship. Where you've been. Who you talked to.

Kael's jaw tightens.

KAEL
What did you tell them?

TOMAS (V.O.)
That I fix thrusters, not read minds. But they weren't asking nicely, Vasaro. They were the kind of people who come back with warrants.

KAEL
I'm sorry, Tomas. I didn't mean to--

TOMAS (V.O.)
(cutting him off)
Save it. Just tell me one thing. Are you in something you can get out of?

Kael looks at Elara. She looks back.

KAEL
(into comm)
No. I'm not.

TOMAS (V.O.)
(pause)
Shit.

KAEL
Don't contact me again. It's not safe.

TOMAS (V.O.)
Vasaro--

KAEL
I mean it. Burn my contact info. Forget you know me.

TOMAS (V.O.)
(quiet)
Twenty years, Kael. You were a pain in the ass, but you were our pain in the ass.

KAEL
(beat)
I know.

YUKI (V.O.)
(in the background)
Tell him to be careful.

KAEL
I heard her. I will.

TOMAS (V.O.)
(final)
Good luck. Whatever this is.

The connection CUTS.

Kael sits back. His face is unreadable, but something has shifted behind his eyes.

ELARA
(quiet)
Friends?

KAEL
The closest I had. Out there.

ELARA
And now?

KAEL
Now they're safer without me.

The weight of it settles over the cockpit. Kael is cutting ties. Burning bridges. Walking into something he can't walk back from.

ELARA
You're giving up a lot. For someone you never met in person.

KAEL
(pause)
Meeting someone isn't the same as knowing them.

He looks at her. Really looks.

KAEL (CONT'D)
Marcus knew me better than anyone. He just... understood. I don't know how to explain it.

ELARA
You don't have to. He said the same thing about you.

They sit with that. The last connection between two people who are gone--him, to death; Kael, to whatever's coming.

LIMINAL (V.O.)
Alert: Traffic approaching. Government identification beacon.

Kael checks the display. A PATROL VESSEL entering the orbital zone.

KAEL
They're not coming for us. But they're looking.

ELARA
What do we do?

Kael makes a decision.

KAEL
We leave.

He starts plotting a new course. Further out. Away from Earth. Away from the patrols. Away from everything.

KAEL (CONT'D)
I know a place. Off the main routes. Someone who might be able to help us crack the key without getting caught.

ELARA
Where?

KAEL
The outer belt. Station called Refuge. It's not on any official charts.

ELARA
(processing)
You're asking me to leave. To go further.

KAEL
I'm telling you what I'm doing. You can come or you can stay.

He meets her eyes.

KAEL (CONT'D)
But if you stay, they'll find you. And whatever Marcus died for dies with him.

She doesn't look away.

ELARA
Then let's go.

Kael nods. Confirms the course.

LIMINAL (V.O.)
Course plotted. Transit time: 23 days.

The engines HUM. The ship begins to move.

EXT. SPACE - THE LIMINAL - CONTINUOUS

The Liminal pivots away from the Moon. Away from Earth. Away from everything familiar.

Her engines FLARE, pushing her toward the distant stars.

Behind her, the planet that created both passengers grows smaller. Disappearing into the black.

Ahead: the void. The unknown. The only direction left.

INT. THE LIMINAL - COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

Kael and Elara watch Earth shrink.

Neither speaks.

There's nothing to say.

The ship carries them forward. Into the dark. Into danger.

Into whatever comes next.

ELARA
(quiet)
Marcus used to say that Earth was like a party where everyone's talking and no one's listening.

KAEL
(equally quiet)
Sounds right.

ELARA
He said you were the only person who actually heard him.

Kael doesn't respond. His throat is tight.

ELARA (CONT'D)
Thank you. For coming back. For... for not letting this go.

KAEL
(after a long pause)
Don't thank me yet. We haven't done anything.

ELARA
You came. That's something.

She looks at him. He keeps his eyes on the stars.

KAEL
Get some rest. It's a long trip.

ELARA
What about you?

KAEL
I'll manage.

She stands. Pauses at the door.

ELARA
Kael.

He turns.

ELARA (CONT'D)
He was right about you.

KAEL
About what?

ELARA
That you were worth knowing.

She leaves.

Kael sits alone in the cockpit. The stars wheel past.

He touches his pocket. The data key.

His hand is trembling. He steadies it.

KAEL
(to himself)
Someone has to.

He turns back to the controls.

The ship flies on.

EXT. SPACE - WIDE SHOT

The Liminal, small against the infinite. A point of light moving through the void.

Behind her, the solar system. Earth and its troubles. The civilization that broke itself.

Ahead, darkness. Stars. The unknown.

Two people, connected by grief. Carrying a dead man's secrets into the black.

The ship disappears into the distance.

FADE TO BLACK.

TITLE CARD: END OF EPISODE 1

FADE OUT.

THE END
