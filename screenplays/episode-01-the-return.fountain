FADE IN:

INT. THE LIMINAL - CREW QUARTERS - DEEP SPACE

DARKNESS. Then--

The soft PING of a ship's system waking up. Status lights blink to life in sequence, casting blue-green shadows across a cramped bunk.

KAEL VASARO (mid-40s) lies on his back, eyes closed. His face is weathered but not hard--more tired than bitter. Graying hair, disheveled, poorly cut. The kind of man who stopped caring about appearances around the same time he stopped caring about most things.

He doesn't move. The ship HUM surrounds him like a blanket.

LIMINAL (V.O.)
(ship AI, female, flat)
Transit complete. Kepler Station approach confirmed. Docking window in forty-three minutes.

Another PING. More insistent.

Kael's eyes open. He stares at the ceiling--metal panels covered in twenty years of modifications. Cable runs. Personal touches. A photograph tucked into a joint seam, too faded to read from here.

He exhales. Not a sigh--just breathing. The first breath of another day that doesn't require anything from him.

A grunt. He sits up slowly. Every joint in his body protests. He ignores it.

The quarters are TIGHT. A bunk barely wide enough for his shoulders. Storage compartments built into every surface. A fold-down desk with a console. Everything within arm's reach.

Twenty years on this ship. Twenty years of wear patterns. Twenty years of making this space HIS.

Kael swings his legs off the bunk. His bare feet touch the deck plating--cold metal, familiar. The HUM rises through his soles.

He reaches for a COFFEE MAKER mounted to the wall. It's been repaired so many times the original parts are probably outnumbered. He hits a button. It GURGLES and HISSES, then produces something approximately like coffee.

He drinks it standing. Staring at nothing.

The coffee maker falls silent. The HUM remains--always the HUM.

LIMINAL (V.O.)
Atmospheric recycling at optimal--

KAEL
Mute.

Silence. Just the HUM and the VOID it fills.

INT. THE LIMINAL - COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

Kael moves forward through the narrow corridor. The cockpit is small but functional--pilot's chair, nav console, wide viewport.

Through the glass: STARS. Endless. And in the distance, growing larger, the rotating ring of KEPLER STATION. Gray metal against black void. Running lights blinking. Ships dotting the approaches like fireflies.

Kael settles into the pilot's chair. It's molded to his body after two decades.

LIMINAL (V.O.)
Docking beacon acquired. Lane assignment: Berth 17-C.

KAEL
(flat)
Accepted.

His voice is rough from disuse. He doesn't talk much.

The station grows in the viewport. A pit stop. Fuel, supplies, and gone.

EXT. KEPLER STATION - DOCKING ARM - LATER

The Liminal slides into her berth. DOCKING CLAMPS engage with a solid THUNK. Umbilicals extend and connect--power, data, atmo.

The ship settles. Goes quiet.

INT. THE LIMINAL - AIRLOCK - CONTINUOUS

Kael stands at the inner door, waiting for pressure equalization. He's dressed now--practical spacer clothes. Worn jacket, navy blue pants, boots that have seen a thousand station decks. A SIDEARM on his hip, holstered but visible. Normal out here.

He reaches toward a small port near the inner door. Unplugs something. Slips it onto his wrist--an unremarkable metal bracelet.

The airlock CYCLES. The outer door opens.

INT. KEPLER STATION - DOCK CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

Kael steps out into the station.

The difference is immediate. A draft of recycled air. Distant mechanical noise. The sterile hum of a place built for function, not comfort.

The dock corridor stretches ahead--wide, clinical, busy in its own way:

-- CARGO BOTS roll past, their chassis scratched and dented. Some move in formation. Others navigate solo, weaving around obstacles.

-- SHIPS of various sizes fill the visible berths. A battered freighter getting its hull patched. A sleek courier vessel with engine panels open. A salvage rig that looks like it was assembled from three different ships.

-- PEOPLE. Dock workers in coveralls. Pilots in flight suits. Merchants. Mechanics. Drifters. Everyone has somewhere to be.

-- MORE BOTS THAN PEOPLE. Service units polishing viewport glass. Maintenance drones crawling along cable runs overhead. Delivery bots weaving between legs. The human-to-machine ratio tilted heavily toward machine.

Kael walks. Not fast, not slow. He moves through the crowd without touching anyone--a skill developed over years. His eyes track everything without focusing on anything.

A CLEANING BOT crosses his path, scrubbing a fuel stain from the deck. He steps around it without slowing.

MARKET STALLS line the corridor walls. Synthetic protein in various shapes. Hydroponic vegetables. Stimulants. Questionable electronics. A man selling "genuine Earth artifacts" that are obviously printed fakes.

The AIR smells like recycled atmo, machine oil, and something cooking with too much spice. The station's ventilation hums overhead, a constant bass note beneath the chaos.

Kael passes a NEWS DISPLAY mounted to a pillar. A talking head mouths silently--some political story. He doesn't look.

EXT. KEPLER STATION - REPAIR BAY 12 - CONTINUOUS

A workshop space open to the dock corridor. Tools hanging on pegboards. Ship components on workbenches. The organized chaos of people who know where everything is.

TOMAS (50s, barrel-chested, practical) is elbow-deep in an engine housing. His husband YUKI (50s, lean, patient face, graying temples) works at a diagnostic console nearby.

Kael approaches. Tomas looks up. His face splits into a grin.

TOMAS
Vasaro. You look like shit.

KAEL
Long haul.

Tomas wipes his hands on a rag.

TOMAS
Where from?

KAEL
Belt. The far side.

YUKI
(without looking up)
The Liminal holding up?

KAEL
Always does.

TOMAS
Got a coupling that'd fit your starboard thruster.

Kael raises an eyebrow slightly. Waiting.

TOMAS (CONT'D)
Fell off a transport. Legally.

KAEL
How much?

TOMAS
For you? Cost plus ten.

KAEL
I'll think about it.

YUKI
(still not looking up)
You always think about it. Then you buy it.

Kael almost smiles. ALMOST. The corner of his mouth twitches, nothing more.

TOMAS
You eating?

KAEL
Getting to it.

TOMAS
Ming's is good today. The noodles.

Kael nods. A minimal acknowledgment. This is the extent of his social interaction--brief, transactional, but not cold. There's familiarity here. The comfortable shorthand of people who've known each other for years without ever becoming friends.

He moves on.

EXT. KEPLER STATION - FOOD STALL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

A narrow passage lined with cooking stations. Steam and smoke. The SIZZLE of protein on hot metal. VENDORS calling out in multiple languages.

Kael stops at a stall run by an OLD WOMAN with cybernetic eyes. Her movements are precise despite her age. She's cooking something unidentifiable--meat, probably. It smells good enough.

OLD WOMAN
The usual?

Kael nods.

She works fast. Skewered protein, some kind of sauce, wrapped in synthetic bread. She hands it to him. He pays with a tap of his wrist.

OLD WOMAN (CONT'D)
You're back soon.

KAEL
Needed supplies.

OLD WOMAN
Don't we all.

He takes his food. Eats it walking. The protein is chewy, overseasoned, exactly what he expected. It's fine. Fine is enough.

EXT. KEPLER STATION - OBSERVATION DECK - CONTINUOUS

A small platform with a viewport looking out at the station's exterior. Ships coming and going. The distant glow of the belt.

Kael stands here, finishing his food. Watching.

TWO WORKERS pass behind him. Young but tired. Together, but you can't tell if they're a couple or just two people on a job.

Kael watches them go. His face reveals nothing.

A SECURITY BOT rolls past, SCANNING faces. Its red eye lingers on Kael for a moment, then moves on. Nothing flagged. He's not interesting.

He finishes eating. Balls up the wrapper. Drops it in a recycler.

Heads back to his ship.

INT. THE LIMINAL - COCKPIT - LATER

Kael settles back into his chair. The familiar embrace.

He pulls up the JOB BOARD on his console. Listings scroll past:

-- "Cargo run to Titan Station - 4 weeks - Standard rate"
-- "Salvage claim dispute escort - Combat certification required"
-- "Medical supplies to Belt Colony 7 - Priority transit"
-- "Data courier - Origin: Earth - Destination: Classified"

He scrolls. Stops on one.

LISTING (ON SCREEN)
"Mineral samples - Kepler to Ceres Outpost. 3 weeks transit. Rate: 12,000 credits. No questions."

Good enough. He accepts it. The confirmation pings.

LIMINAL (V.O.)
Route calculation initiated. Estimated transit time: 19 days, 4 hours.

KAEL
Start it.

While the nav computer works, he pulls up a secondary display. Tabs through options. Lands on: NEWS FEED.

He doesn't know why he does it. He never does. Habit, maybe. Or masochism.

INT. THE LIMINAL - COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

The feed fills his screen. Talking heads. Graphics. The endless churn.

HEADLINE CRAWLER: "LOCKE CAMPAIGN IN FREEFALL AFTER FUNDING REVELATIONS"

Kael's eyes flick to the story. A VIDEO plays:

VANESSA LOCKE (50s, composed, professional) stands at a podium. She looks tired. The kind of tired that comes from defending yourself against attacks from every direction.

NEWS ANCHOR (V.O.)
(from the feed)
Independent candidate Vanessa Locke suspended her campaign today amid escalating allegations of financial impropriety--

Kael taps to another channel. Different talking head. Different angle.

NEWS ANCHOR 2 (V.O.)
--the progressive coalition has called for a full investigation into what they're calling "a shocking betrayal of stated values"--

Another tap. Another channel.

NEWS ANCHOR 3 (V.O.)
--conservative groups are demanding accountability, citing Locke's alleged ties to globalist banking interests--

Kael's jaw tightens slightly. He taps through more feeds:

CHANNEL 7: "LOCKE EXPOSED: Dark money ties reveal centrist fraud"

NEWSNET: "LOCKE UNMASKED: Progressive policies funded by offshore elites"

Same footage. Same woman. Different villains depending on who's watching.

Kael stares at the screen. His expression doesn't change, but something behind his eyes does. A familiar disappointment. The bone-deep weariness of someone who expected nothing and is still let down.

KAEL
(barely audible)
Yeah.

He closes the political feeds. Scrolls past them. Station updates. Shipping manifests. Celebrity gossip. An ad for memory enhancement implants.

The usual churn.

Then--

He stops scrolling.

HEADLINE (ON SCREEN)
"Federal Auditor Dies in New Francisco Apartment Fire. Twin Sister Survived."

Kael stares at it.

His finger hovers over the screen.

CLOSE ON his eyes. Something flickering. The smallest crack in the wall.

He taps the story.

INT. THE LIMINAL - COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

The article expands:

TEXT (ON SCREEN)
"...Federal Accounts Division employee found deceased following residential fire in the Tenderloin district of New Francisco. The cause of the blaze remains under investigation. The victim's twin sister, who was present at the time, escaped with minor injuries and is cooperating with authorities..."

No name in the headline. "Federal Accounts Division." "New Francisco district." "Twin sister."

Kael's face is very still.

KAEL
(quiet)
No.

He searches. Types quickly: "Federal Accounts Division New Francisco employees."

Results populate. He scrolls through faces, names, departments.

Stops on one.

MARCUS OYELARAN. The photo shows a man about Kael's age. Thoughtful eyes. The kind of face that doesn't give much away. The bio lists: "Senior Auditor, Federal Accounts Division, Western Region."

Kael stares at the photo.

KAEL
(quiet)
Shit, Marcus.

FLASHBACK - QUICK CUTS:

-- TEXT on a screen: "You awake?" "Yeah. Can't sleep." "Same. What time is it there?" "Late."

-- A voice message, MARCUS's voice: "Called about the thing. They're stonewalling. Surprise surprise."

-- Another text exchange: "You ever think about just... leaving?" "And do what? Federal auditing doesn't exactly transfer to the belt colonies. All I know is spreadsheets and fraud patterns."

-- A later message, Marcus again: "Besides. Dad's latest scheme fell apart. Again. Someone's gotta help Mom keep the lights on. Not all of us are as free as you."

BACK TO PRESENT:

Kael's hand is trembling slightly. He steadies it.

LIMINAL (V.O.)
Route calculation complete. Ready to depart.

Kael doesn't move.

He reads the article again. "Apartment fire." "Cause under investigation." "Twin sister survived."

His jaw works. Something building behind the stillness.

LIMINAL (V.O.)
Awaiting departure confirmation.

Kael reaches for the console. His finger hovers over the "Confirm" button.

He doesn't press it.

Instead, he opens the nav system. Cancels the job.

LIMINAL (V.O.)
Job canceled. Penalty fee applied to account.

Kael ignores it. He's already typing a new destination.

NEW DESTINATION (ON SCREEN): EARTH - NEW FRANCISCO APPROACH - PRIORITY TRANSIT

LIMINAL (V.O.)
Warning: Earth transit requires current documentation and landing permits. Your credentials have not been updated in--

KAEL
Override.

LIMINAL (V.O.)
Calculating priority route. Estimated transit: 11 days.

KAEL
Do it.

He hits the release sequence. The docking clamps DISENGAGE.

EXT. KEPLER STATION - DOCKING ARM - CONTINUOUS

The Liminal pulls away from the berth. Umbilicals disconnect and retract. The ship pivots, nose orienting toward the void.

INT. THE LIMINAL - COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

Kael watches the station shrink in the viewport.

His face is stone. But his eyes--his eyes are burning.

KAEL
(quiet)
What did you find, Marcus?

EXT. SPACE - CONTINUOUS

The Liminal accelerates. Her engines flare bright, then brighter.

Kepler Station dwindles behind her. The ship becomes a point of light, streaking toward the distant inner system.

Toward Earth.

Toward a place Kael stopped thinking about a long time ago.

TITLE CARD:

T E T H E R

The title BURNS IN, then FADES slowly as the ship's light disappears into the black.

FADE TO:

INT. THE LIMINAL - CREW QUARTERS - LATER

Kael asleep in his bunk. Dead to the world.

A PING from the ship's system. He doesn't move.

Another PING. His hand reaches out, slaps the console. Silence.

He settles back into sleep.

The coffee maker GURGLES to life on its timer. HISSES. SPUTTERS. The smell of something approximately like coffee fills the quarters.

Kael's eyes open. He stares at the ceiling. Exhales.

Drags himself up.

INT. THE LIMINAL - COCKPIT - LATER

Kael in the pilot's chair, coffee in hand. Through the viewport: Earth, filling the view.

LIMINAL (V.O.)
Approaching Earth orbital space. Traffic control handoff initiated.

Kael straightens in his chair.

LIMINAL (V.O.)
Be advised: Documentation check required at orbital checkpoint.

KAEL
What's our status?

LIMINAL (V.O.)
Your credentials show last planetary landing: twenty years, three months, seven days ago. System flagged for manual review.

KAEL
And?

LIMINAL (V.O.)
Review completed. Landing permit approved. Note attached: "Welcome back."

Kael says nothing. Welcome back. The two least appropriate words in any language.

EXT. EARTH ORBIT - CONTINUOUS

The Liminal slides into a berth at a massive ORBITAL STATION. Docking clamps engage. The ship is SCANNED by multiple sensor arrays. Transponder exchanges happen automatically.

Through the viewport: Earth. Kael doesn't linger on it.

INT. ORBITAL STATION - SHUTTLE TERMINAL - LATER

Kael moves through the crowded terminal. Travelers everywhere--business suits, family groups, laborers heading down for contract work. He finds his gate. Boards a SURFACE SHUTTLE with forty other passengers.

INT. SURFACE SHUTTLE - CONTINUOUS

Kael sits by a window. The shuttle detaches, angles toward atmosphere. He watches without seeing. His mind elsewhere.

Marcus, what did you get yourself into?

EXT. NEW FRANCISCO - LOWER DISTRICT - TRANSIT STATION - DUSK

Underground platform. Kael emerges from a TRANSIT CAR with a crowd of commuters. He moves through the turnstiles, up the stairs, onto the street.

The Lower District. Old buildings, dense blocks, infrastructure that was state-of-the-art two decades ago.

He checks his sidearm. Takes a breath. Starts walking.

EXT. NEW FRANCISCO - LOWER DISTRICT - STREET - CONTINUOUS

Kael steps into the flow of foot traffic.

The ASSAULT is immediate.

SOUND: Traffic. Voices. Music bleeding from storefronts. Advertisements. Sirens in the distance. The hum of a thousand machines. The never-ending PULSE of a city that never stops.

SMELL: Exhaust. Synthetic food. Rain on hot pavement. A chemical sweetness that might be perfume or might be pollution.

SIGHT: People EVERYWHERE. Packed onto sidewalks. Spilling out of buildings. Moving in streams and eddies around obstacles. All of them looking at screens. All of them somewhere else.

Kael stands very still.

A PEDESTRIAN bumps into him, doesn't apologize, keeps walking, eyes never leaving their wrist display.

Another pedestrian. Another. Everyone walking blind, trusting their peripheral vision.

Kael starts walking. His body language is WRONG here. Too much space around his movements. Too much awareness of his surroundings. He looks like what he is--an outsider.

A BEGGAR reaches toward him from a doorway. Kael sidesteps without acknowledgment. The beggar doesn't seem to notice.

The NOISE is worse than he remembered. Speakers on every corner. Music bleeding from storefronts. A hundred conversations layered on top of each other.

From a storefront speaker, a PODCAST bleeds into the street:

PODCAST HOST (V.O.)
--and that's exactly what they want you to think. The moderates are the real extremists, because they enable--

From another direction, an AD plays on loop:

ADVERTISEMENT (V.O.)
They said I could trust them! Don't make my mistake. TrustVer--because in a world of deep fakes, you deserve to know what's real.

Kael reaches into his jacket. Pulls out a pair of NOISE-CANCELLING HEADPHONES. Old model, well-worn. He puts them on.

The world goes QUIET.

BROWN NOISE fills his ears--the steady, familiar hum. Like The Liminal's systems. Like home.

He walks faster. The chaos continues around him, but he's insulated now. Safe in his bubble.

He passes a STREET PREACHER on a corner, mouth moving silently--Kael can't hear a word. The preacher gestures wildly at nothing. Nobody's listening. Bots clean around his feet without slowing.

Kael turns down a side street. Narrower. Darker. The buildings press closer. Fire escapes zigzag overhead. LAUNDRY hangs from windows. The first signs of actual human habitation.

He checks his wrist unit. A MAP displays. Destination highlighted.

KAEL
(quiet)
Three more blocks.

He keeps moving.

EXT. NEW FRANCISCO - TENDERLOIN DISTRICT - MARCUS'S BUILDING - NIGHT

The address.

A residential tower, maybe fifteen stories. Old but maintained. The kind of place working people live--too poor to leave, too stable to fall further.

Kael stands across the street, looking up.

THIRD FLOOR. The window of Marcus's unit is BLACKENED. Scorch marks spread up the exterior like fingers reaching toward the sky. A section of wall is MISSING--exposed framework, charred insulation.

The surrounding windows are intact. Other units undamaged.

Yellow caution tape hangs from the building entrance. One strip has been cut.

Kael removes his headphones. Lets them hang around his neck. He needs to hear now.

Kael checks his surroundings. The street is sparse--a few pedestrians, none paying attention. A FOOD VENDOR packing up for the night. A DRONE passing overhead, sweeping the area with a spotlight before moving on.

He crosses the street.

INT. MARCUS'S BUILDING - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

The lobby is small and worn. A SECURITY DESK sits empty--the screen showing a maintenance notice. "Guard station unstaffed during off-hours. All visitors must register via mobile app."

Kael doesn't register. He walks past, toward the elevators.

One elevator is OUT OF SERVICE--taped off. The other is working. He takes it.

INT. MARCUS'S BUILDING - ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

Kael stands alone as the car rises. His reflection in the polished metal door--a stranger in a strange land.

The elevator PINGS. Third floor.

INT. MARCUS'S BUILDING - THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

The doors open. The SMELL hits first.

Burnt plastic. Charred wood. The lingering chemical bite of fire suppressant. Under it all, something organic. Something wrong.

Kael steps out.

The hallway is dimly lit--half the fixtures dead, casualties of the fire. SOOT stains the walls near Marcus's unit. The carpet is discolored, water-damaged.

Marcus's door is at the end.

It's OPEN. The frame warped, the lock mechanism melted into uselessness. More caution tape--cut, hanging loose.

Kael draws his sidearm. Moves quietly.

He reaches the doorway. Listens.

VOICES inside. Low. Professional.

VOICE 1 (O.S.)
(filtered through tactical mask)
Negative on the desk. Already cleared.

VOICE 2 (O.S.)
Check the vents. These places always have dead space.

Kael edges closer. Looks through the gap.

INT. MARCUS'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

The apartment is DESTROYED. Fire damage everywhere--walls black, furniture melted or collapsed, ceiling panels hanging loose. Water damage has made the floor treacherous.

TWO FIGURES pick through the wreckage. Police gear, no badges. One yanks at a vent cover, impatient. The other waves a handheld scanner over a collapsed bookshelf without really looking at the readout.

A duffel bag on the floor, half-full of random salvage.

Kael's eyes scan the room. The layout is visible despite the damage--living area, kitchenette, doorway to what must have been a bedroom. Personal effects reduced to ash and fragments.

Then he sees it.

On a WARPED SHELF near where a bathroom once was--half-melted, discolored, but intact--a small PLASTIC CASE. Rectangular. Hinged.

A contact lens holder.

FLASHBACK - QUICK:

KAEL (V.O.)
(from an old message, teasing)
Got you something. Contacts would suit you better. Make you look less like someone's grandfather.

MARCUS'S VOICE (V.O.)
(dry)
It's a contact lens case.

KAEL (V.O.)
Was 2-for-1, so I got one for you. No offense, but I have no one else to give it to.

MARCUS'S VOICE (V.O.)
(laughing)
Asshole.

BACK TO PRESENT:

Kael's jaw tightens.

One of the figures turns. His scanner sweeps toward Kael's position.

FIGURE 1
Hey--

He fumbles for his weapon.

Kael MOVES.

INT. MARCUS'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

GUNFIRE. Wild. Figure 1's first shots go wide, punching holes in the ceiling.

Kael dives behind the remains of a collapsed couch.

Figure 2 opens fire--spraying rounds without aiming. The couch shreds. Kael stays low.

He returns fire. Two shots. Figure 2 staggers, clutching his arm.

FIGURE 2
Shit! SHIT!

Kael vaults the couch, sprinting across the room. Shots behind him, haphazard--one clips the wall by his head, the next hits nothing.

He reaches the shelf. Grabs the contact lens case. Pockets it.

FIGURE 1
He grabbed something!

Kael spins. The bathroom--what's left of it--has a VENT ACCESS near the ceiling. He's already moving.

He LEAPS, catches the edge of the vent, PULLS himself up as gunfire SHREDS the wall below him.

INT. MARCUS'S BUILDING - VENTILATION SHAFT - CONTINUOUS

Kael crawls. Fast. The space is tight--barely wide enough for his shoulders. The metal groans under his weight.

Behind him, shouting. Confusion.

FIGURE 1 (O.S.)
(muffled)
Where'd he go?

Kael reaches a junction. Chooses left. Crawls faster.

The shaft ENDS at another vent cover. He can see through the slats--a HALLWAY. Different floor. Maybe second.

He KICKS the cover out. Drops through.

INT. MARCUS'S BUILDING - SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Kael lands hard, rolls, comes up running.

The hallway is residential--doors on both sides. A few are OPEN, residents peering out at the noise. An OLD MAN in a bathrobe. A YOUNG WOMAN with a child on her hip.

KAEL
(as he runs)
Get inside. Lock your doors.

They stare. He's gone before they can respond.

STAIRWELL. He hits the door, takes the stairs up.

INT. MARCUS'S BUILDING - STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

Kael climbs. His legs burn but they don't fail him.

BELOW: boots on metal. Shouting.

FIGURE 2 (O.S.)
He's going up!

FIGURE 1 (O.S.)
Go, go!

Kael reaches the FOURTH FLOOR door. Opens it. Closes it loudly.

But doesn't go through. He waits.

FOOTSTEPS pound past, going up.

He slips back into the stairwell. Goes DOWN.

INT. MARCUS'S BUILDING - FIRST FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

Kael emerges into a service corridor. Basement access, utility rooms, a back exit.

He takes the EXIT.

EXT. MARCUS'S BUILDING - ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

The alley is narrow, dark, lined with refuse processors and recycling units. The smell is overwhelming.

Kael moves fast but not running. Walks with purpose, keeping to shadows.

He reaches the street. Turns right. Away from the building.

SIRENS begin in the distance. Getting closer.

He walks faster.

EXT. NEW FRANCISCO - TENDERLOIN DISTRICT - SIDE STREETS - CONTINUOUS

Kael navigates the maze of side streets. Taking turns at random. Putting distance between himself and the scene.

The streets are emptier here--late night, residential, working-class neighborhood asleep or pretending to be. The occasional drone passes overhead. He avoids their lights.

He stops. Listens. Nothing. No boots. No pursuit.

He exhales. Pulls his HEADPHONES back on. The HUM returns. His shoulders drop slightly.

He keeps moving. Faster now.

A CORNER. He turns it, looking back over his shoulder--

He doesn't hear her footsteps. The headphones. The brown noise.

COLLISION.

His shoulder CONNECTS with someone's face. Hard.

A WOMAN. She goes DOWN, hitting the pavement. Doesn't get up.

Kael stumbles, catches himself.

He takes three steps.

Stops.

Looks back.

She's on the ground. Not moving. The streetlight here is flickering, half-dead.

Kael pulls off his headphones. The world comes rushing back--sirens, still distant. No immediate pursuit.

He goes back.

She's BREATHING. Just knocked out. Her face is turned away, hair covering her features.

He grabs her under the arms. DRAGS her toward a doorway--an alcove, recessed, dark.

KAEL
(muttering)
Come on...

He props her against the wall. She slumps but stays sitting. Still unconscious.

His hands check her for injuries. No blood. No obvious breaks. Just knocked cold.

He pulls out his phone. Activates the light.

And FREEZES.

CLOSE ON: ELARA OYELARAN'S FACE

The same face as Marcus. Feminine. Softer. But the bone structure is identical. The eyes--closed now--are the same shape, the same set.

FLASHBACK - QUICK:

NEWS HEADLINE (V.O.)
"...Twin sister survived..."

BACK TO PRESENT:

KAEL
(barely a whisper)
Elara.

SIRENS. Closer now. Much closer.

Kael looks up. Through the alcove opening, he can see the street beginning to FILL.

Vehicles roll past--unmarked SUVs, a van with a faded agency logo. Men climb out in mismatched gear, some in vests, some not. Holstered pistols, a few shotguns. They spread out like they're following a script none of them memorized.

EXT. NEW FRANCISCO - TENDERLOIN DISTRICT - STREET - CONTINUOUS

The crackdown begins.

SOLDIERS move door to door. POUNDING. DEMANDING. Residents dragged into the street for processing.

An OLD MAN protests. He's STRUCK with a baton, forced to his knees.

A FAMILY emerges, hands raised. CHILDREN CRYING. They're pushed against a wall, scanned, questioned.

DRONES flood the airspace, spotlights sweeping the streets, scanning every face.

Shouts. Screams. The sounds of a neighborhood being torn apart.

INT. ALCOVE - CONTINUOUS

Kael watches through a gap in the doorway.

ELARA stirs.

Kael turns. She's coming to. Her eyes flutter, trying to focus. Her hand goes to her head--pain.

ELARA
(groggy)
Wh... what...

Her eyes find Kael. A stranger. Crouched over her in the dark.

Her face cycles through confusion -- pain -- fear -- rising panic.

Outside: SIRENS. BOOTS. SCREAMING. The crackdown tearing the neighborhood apart.

She opens her mouth--

SMASH CUT TO BLACK.

SILENCE.

Hold on black for a long beat.

Then -- distant, muffled -- the sounds of the crackdown continuing. Sirens. Shouts. A child crying somewhere.

The sounds fade.

TITLE CARD:

T E T H E R

The title holds. Then fades.

BLACK.

FADE OUT.
