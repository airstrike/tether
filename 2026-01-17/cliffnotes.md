## THE ORIGIN

The initial spark wasn't a game. It was a dream:

> "Someone who lives in space in their own ship, traveling alone across the stars, only meeting people on occasion."

A fantasy of solitude. The romantic loneliness of the drifter. Not running from something specific — just... not wanting to be around people anymore.

---

## EARLY REFERENCE POINTS

Before the game idea solidified, we explored existing works that capture the "alone in space" feeling:

### Anime/Manga
- **Galaxy Express 999** — Space train, stopping at planets, passing through
- **Voices of a Distant Star** — A girl drifting further into space, texts taking years to arrive
- **Cowboy Bebop** — Melancholy drifter energy; Spike feels alone even in a crew
- **Planetes** — Quiet, working-class-in-space atmosphere

### Film
- **Silent Running** (1972) — Man alone on a ship with robot drones, tending Earth's last forests. Closest to the original dream.
- **Moon** (2009) — Solo lunar mining stint. Contemplative isolation.

### Books
- **The Murderbot Diaries** — A robot who wants to be left alone and watch TV
- **To Be Taught, If Fortunate** — Quiet, unhurried space exploration

### Games
- **Outer Wilds** — Solo ship, solar system of mysteries, no combat, pure exploration and wonder

## THE GAME IDEA EMERGES

The pitch: "Like Spike Spiegel but alone in space."

Key parameters established early:
- Pixel art (solo indie dev feasibility)
- A "bonafide misanthrope"
- Becomes reluctant savior of the Earth he loathes
- After spending two decades traveling the stars

The question asked: *What draws you to this?*

The answer: **PPIM** — Perpetually Present, Increasing Misanthropy.

Later revised to: **PPPIM** — Perpetually Present, Perennially Increasing Misanthropy.

This became the creative fuel. The game isn't made *despite* the feeling — it's made *from* it. The MC is the creator with the volume turned up.

## EARLY NARRATIVE THOUGHTS

### The Ship as Home
The ship isn't just transportation. It's the real home. The player should *feel* that:
- A pixel cockpit they return to
- Customization over time
- Familiarity and safety
- Contrast with how alien Earth feels on return

### The Reluctance is the Story
What drags someone like this back?
- A debt?
- A person?
- A threat so big his misanthropy becomes irrelevant?

The "why" was identified as the slow-burn mystery.

### Genre Considerations
Early question: Narrative-driven (dialogue, choices, VN-ish) or gameplay-forward (trading, exploration, combat)?

Resolution: **Both, but narrative leads.**
- Choices and exploration as primary
- Trading as economic loop + information gathering
- Light combat — serves story, makes things fun, not skill tests
- Half-Life cited as model: combat exists but the game is "about so much more"

---

## THE BACKSTORY — WHY HE LEFT

This section was crucial. The MC's departure from Earth needed to feel earned, not edgy.

### The Quiet Damage
Not "rough childhood." Not a single traumatic event. Just:
- Introvert nature
- Parents present but hardly talking
- Parents mostly fighting each other
- No tether formed
- Melancholy and loneliness as baseline

He never developed the ability to connect. It's not dramatic — it's just absence. Emotional white noise where connection should be.

### The Progression
Moving became the pattern:
- Schools
- Cities
- Countries
- Planets (the next logical step)

When the technology existed to leave entirely? Of course he did. It wasn't even dramatic. He just didn't come back one day.

### The 20 Years
Important distinction: he's not running anymore.

He *was* running, maybe for the first few years. But somewhere along the way, running turned into *living*. He found his rhythm:
- The ship
- The silence
- Brief transactional encounters at stations
- A nod to a familiar face at a fuel depot, then gone

He built something that *works* for him. He's not miserable. He's *content*.

That makes the disruption worse.

## THE INCITING INCIDENT — EARLY VERSIONS

### The Friend Concept
The idea of "the one friend" emerged:
- Met online
- Never up close
- But a strong tie
- Something reminds MC of the friend
- He looks the friend up
- Discovers X
- Solving X is the initial driver

### What X Could Be (Brainstormed Options)
1. **Dead.** Officially suicide. But something's wrong about it.
2. **Missing.** Erased. Records scrubbed too clean.
3. **Alive but different.** Changed. Involved in something.
4. **A message.** Left for MC specifically. A dead drop waiting years.

The Andor Season 1 parallel was cited: dragged into a bigger plot unwittingly. Small choices leading to entanglement.

## THE FRIEND — CHARACTER EVOLUTION

### DISCARDED VERSION: Sera
Originally conceived as:
- **Sera Okoye**
- Female
- A journalist
- Curious, warm, persistent
- Saw something in Kael worth reaching
- Killed for her investigation
- Left breadcrumbs

### WHY IT WAS CHANGED
- "Journalist" felt overdone
- Female friend felt too far-fetched for this particular misanthrope MC
- The connection needed to feel more plausible for who Kael is

### FINAL VERSION: Marcus
- **Marcus Oyelaran**
- Male
- Government auditor (Federal Accounts Division)
- Took the job because it was stable, not because he cared
- Wicked smart but not interested in anything
- Supported his financially irresponsible parents — just did it, no complaints
- Found Kael online — two checked-out guys in the static
- Didn't go looking for conspiracy; just followed the numbers
- Had no career ambition to protect, so he kept pulling the thread
- That's what got him killed

The connection works because: two smart, disengaged men who understood each other precisely because neither was pretending to be okay.

---

## EARTH — THE WORLD HE RETURNS TO

Described as: "The same, but on steroids."

### The Decay
- Social media replaced traditional human interaction
- Everything ad-ridden
- Corrupt politicians lie openly
- Corporations too big to fail
- Startups become unicorns via concentrated billionaire power
- Everyone selfish, sheepish
- **Connected but not loving**
- Missing something

### The Mirror
Key insight: Earth became what his childhood home was.

Present but absent. Bodies in rooms, eyes on screens. Everyone performing connection while starving for it.

He left because he felt like an alien among humans. He returns to find humanity has alienated *itself*. Everyone's him now — except they don't know what they're missing.

Question raised: Does that make him angrier? Or sadder?

---

## THE THEMATIC CORE

### The Central Phrase
**"Connected but not loving."**

This emerged organically and became the thesis. The world optimized for engagement and lost presence.

### The Question the Game Asks
*When you've given up on people, what's left that's still worth protecting?*

### The Answer
*The people who didn't give up on you.*

---

## TRAGEDY VS. HOPE

### The Discussion
Question posed: Does this story have hope in it? Not optimism — but the possibility that connection is still worth something?

Or is it a tragedy?

### The Resolution
It's a tragedy. But from the tragedy comes:
- A rekindling sense of purpose
- Not hope — obligation
- "Do right by them"
- "Not sit on the sidelines when unwillingly turned hero"

### The Turn
He doesn't come back believing in people. He never does. The friend is gone — the last thread that could have pulled him toward softness is cut.

So it's not hope that moves him. It's something colder and more durable:

> *Someone has to.*

Not because they deserve saving. Not because he wants to. But because he's *there*, and he *saw*, and walking away would make him complicit.

Leaving now would mean abandoning the only person who mattered *twice*.

### The Crack
Maybe — *maybe* — in the doing of it, something small shifts. Not transformation. Not "he learns to love again." Just:
- A moment where someone surprises him
- A kindness he didn't expect
- Not enough to change his mind
- But enough that he notices

The player doesn't get catharsis. They get something true.

---

## WHAT HE DOES OUT THERE

Established that his work keeps him moving with minimal human contact:
- Courier work
- Salvage
- Whatever pays

This also serves gameplay: trading as economic loop, traders hear things, cargo has stories.

## HOLLYWOOD / SCREENWRITING PROCESS

### The Stages
1. **Logline** — 1-2 sentences. The hook.
2. **Pitch document / Bible** — 5-15 pages. Premise, tone, characters, world, structure.
3. **The room pitch** — You *tell* the story, don't read it. Perform it. 10-20 minutes.
4. **If they bite** — Treatment (detailed prose outline), then script. For games: GDD with narrative bible.

### The Harness (Story Structure Tools)
- Three-act structure (setup, confrontation, resolution)
- Save the Cat beats (15 emotional story beats)
- Character want vs. need (external goal vs. internal wound)
- Theme stated early

### For This Game
Structure as acts/chapters, each with:
- A central question
- New characters
- A revelation that reframes what the player thought they knew

## OPEN THREADS (Not Yet Resolved)

These were flagged but not developed:

1. **What exactly did Marcus find?** The conspiracy's specifics remain undefined. This is the load-bearing wall.

2. **What reminds Kael of Marcus after 20 years?** The inciting trigger.

3. **Does Kael survive the ending?** Unresolved whether this is a sacrifice play.

4. **What does "winning" look like?** In a world this broken, what constitutes victory?

5. **The supporting cast details:**
   - The fixer who knew Marcus
   - The corporate whistleblower
   - The naive true believer in a resistance
   - The old spacer who remembers when Earth meant something

---

## MISC NOTES & STRAY THOUGHTS

- The ship is called **THE LIMINAL** — a character in its own right
- The name **KAEL VASARO** was established (no discussion of alternatives)
- Pixel art confirmed as aesthetic (solo indie dev reality)
- Synth score with jazz undertones mentioned as audio direction
- "Rain on neon" as visual shorthand
- Violence should feel costly, not fun
- Choices aren't good/evil — they're open/closed (how much does Kael let in?)

---

## THE CREATOR'S FUEL

This project is explicitly personal. The PPPIM isn't a joke — it's the engine.

The disconnection, the exhaustion with cynicism and performance, the creeping sense that something essential is being optimized out of existence, the friendships that exist entirely in text between people who've never shared a room but understand each other better than anyone nearby.

That's real. That's why this works.
