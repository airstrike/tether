# TETHER: Master IP Development Plan
## From Pitch Bible to Complete Narrative

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Current State:** Strong pitch bible with defined protagonist, thematic core, and three-act skeleton. Critical load-bearing elements remain undefined (the conspiracy, inciting incident, supporting cast, ending).

**End State:** A complete, production-ready story bible with full scene-by-scene narrative, character arcs, dialogue samples, and world documentation sufficient to begin game development or pitch to production partners.

---

## PHASE 0: FOUNDATION LOCK
*Resolve the load-bearing questions before building anything on top of them.*

### 0.1 The Conspiracy Definition
The single most critical undefined element. Everything else hangs on this.

**Deliverable:** A 2-3 page document answering:
- What exactly did Marcus discover?
- Who is responsible (specific entities, not just "corporations")?
- What is the mechanism (how does it work)?
- What is the endgame (what happens if it succeeds)?
- Why does it matter to Kael specifically (beyond Marcus)?

**Requirements:**
- Must feel plausible within 2147 world-building
- Must scale appropriately (Act I: personal, Act II: systemic, Act III: existential)
- Must have a physical/tangible component Kael can pursue (breadcrumb trail)
- Must be worse than simple corruption — something that ends meaningful human autonomy

**Suggested directions to explore:**
- Attention economy weaponized (consciousness harvesting?)
- Social credit evolution (autonomy elimination by design)
- Memory/identity manipulation at scale
- Manufactured consent perfected to the point of irreversibility

### 0.2 The Inciting Incident
What makes Kael look up Marcus after 20 years of silence?

**Deliverable:** A single scene (1-2 pages) that:
- Feels organic, not contrived
- Reflects who Kael is (a man who doesn't reach out)
- Creates urgency without melodrama

**Options to consider:**
- Marcus sent something before he died (a message, a package, coordinates)
- A news item Kael stumbles across (Marcus's death reported, or not reported when it should be)
- A mutual contact reaches out (rare enough to be alarming)
- An anniversary or date that triggers a routine check-in attempt
- Something Kael notices in his own work/trading that connects

### 0.3 The Ending Decision
Does Kael survive? What does victory look like?

**Deliverable:** Ending manifesto (2-3 pages) defining:
- Victory conditions (what is "saved" and what is the cost?)
- Kael's fate (survival, sacrifice, or ambiguous?)
- Emotional landing (what does the player/reader feel?)
- Thematic closure (how does this answer "what's worth protecting?")

**Constraints:**
- No cheap hope — this world doesn't transform
- No nihilism — survival must mean something
- The crack in his detachment must manifest in the finale
- "Someone has to" must land as earned truth, not slogan

## IMMEDIATE NEXT ACTIONS

**Block 1 begins with:**
1. Conspiracy definition session — answer the five core questions
2. Inciting incident decision — choose and draft the scene
3. Ending manifesto — decide Kael's fate and what victory means

Everything else is built on these three pillars. Get them wrong, and the structure collapses. Get them right, and the rest is execution.

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

This plan succeeds when:
- [ ] A reader can experience the complete story start to finish
- [ ] Every character choice is motivated and tracked
- [ ] The conspiracy is specific, plausible, and properly terrifying
- [ ] The theme lands without preaching
- [ ] The ending earns its emotion
- [ ] A developer could build the game from these documents
- [ ] A pitch deck could sell this to production partners

*"Someone has to."*
*Let's make sure it's worth it.*
