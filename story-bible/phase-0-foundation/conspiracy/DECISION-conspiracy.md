# DECISION REQUIRED: The Conspiracy
## What did Marcus discover?

---

## CONTEXT

This is the single most critical undefined element in TETHER. Everything else hangs on this decision: the investigation structure, the antagonists, the world-building details, and ultimately what "victory" means.

The conspiracy must:
- Feel plausible within 2147 world-building
- Scale appropriately (Act I: personal, Act II: systemic, Act III: existential)
- Have physical/tangible breadcrumbs Kael can pursue
- Be worse than simple corruption — something that ends meaningful human autonomy
- Connect to the theme: "Connected but not loving"

Four concepts were developed. Here are the curated options:

---

## OPTION A: Attenuation (Neural Preference Engineering)

**Summary:** A neural lace implant program, marketed as cognitive enhancement, is actually engineering human preferences at the neurological level. People remain conscious and feel satisfied, but their desires are being reprogrammed to align with system objectives. The program started in prisons and is expanding toward full population saturation.

**The Hook:** "They make choices, but only from a narrowed menu. They feel satisfied, but only with what the system wants them to want."

**Strengths:**
- Visceral, body-horror element (hardware in your brain)
- Clear physical evidence trail (the implants themselves, installation sites)
- Terrifying because victims don't want to be saved — they feel better
- Strong visual/gameplay potential (can Kael get implanted? resist it?)

**Risks:**
- Requires significant neural-tech world-building
- May feel too "Black Mirror" — familiar territory
- Mandatory implants might strain plausibility (why would people accept them?)

**Implications for Story:**
- Marcus discovered the procurement fraud
- Physical investigation: detention facilities, psychiatric wards, implant hardware
- Antagonists: NeuroSync corporation + government Oversight Bureau
- Victory condition: Expose the program? Destroy the infrastructure?

## OPTION B: Autonomy Erosion (Algorithmic Social Credit)

**Summary:** Five mega-corporations have embedded proprietary algorithms into every government system. These algorithms don't just track behavior — they control access to housing, healthcare, employment, and eventually shape desires so thoroughly that people internalize the system's preferences as their own will. Marcus found the source code with explicit "post-autonomy compliance targets."

**The Hook:** "The isolation and disconnection Kael fled wasn't inevitable; it was *engineered*."

**Strengths:**
- Most directly connected to present-day concerns (feels prescient, not fantastical)
- No special hardware required — uses existing systems
- Marcus's auditor role fits perfectly (he found it in the numbers)
- Devastating personal hook: Kael's misanthropy was the system's final victory

**Risks:**
- More abstract — harder to visualize
- Less visceral threat (no implants, no physical danger from the system itself)
- "Evil algorithm" can feel hand-wavy without careful execution

**Implications for Story:**
- Marcus found the source code hidden across financial transfers
- Digital investigation: following money, finding the algorithm's parameters
- Antagonists: Five corporate consortium (NEXUS, PATHFINDER, HELIX, SENTINEL, SYNTHESIS)
- Victory condition: Release the source code? Prove intentional design?

## OPTION C: Memory Archive (Identity Rewriting)

**Summary:** Mandatory neural-sync "backup" implants are actually being used to rewrite memories. Memories of dissent, genuine connection, and solidarity are being surgically replaced with synthetic equivalents that produce the same dopamine response as engagement metrics. Marcus discovered he'd been edited and was backing up his real memories before they killed him.

**The Hook:** "A person 'remembers' playing with their daughter, but the memory has been edited so it triggers the same dopamine response as getting two thousand upvotes."

**Strengths:**
- Most thematically resonant with "connected but not loving"
- Deeply personal for Kael — he may have been edited, Marcus left him memories of himself
- Creates mystery within mystery (what memories are real?)
- Emotional devastation potential (Kael recovering memories of things taken from him)

**Risks:**
- Complex to track narratively (which memories are real?)
- Could become confusing for player/reader
- "Memories are fake" is well-trodden (Total Recall, Blade Runner, etc.)

**Implications for Story:**
- Marcus left dead-drops with real memories for Kael
- Personal investigation: Kael recovering his own stolen past
- Antagonists: Engagement Commission + Helix Neurotech + PRESERVE division
- Victory condition: Restore authentic memories? Destroy RESONANCE algorithm?

---

## OPTION D: The Prediction Machine (Manufactured Determinism)

**Summary:** A system so sophisticated it can predict what any investigator will discover, then alter the evidence environment so they arrive at predetermined conclusions through their own logic. Marcus noticed his investigation was running on rails — the same discoveries made by auditors years apart, in the same sequence. He tried to deviate and was immediately flagged.

**The Hook:** "You remain conscious, free to decide — but the decision is already optimized. You believe you chose differently; the system simply knew you'd choose this anyway."

**Strengths:**
- Most philosophically ambitious (questions whether choice itself is real)
- Creates unique narrative tension (is Kael's investigation also predicted?)
- Marcus was killed for being *unpredictable* — a data anomaly
- Kael's purpose becomes introducing chaos into a deterministic system

**Risks:**
- Hardest to make concrete and investigable
- Could feel defeatist (if everything is predicted, why bother?)
- Abstract threat — what do you shoot at?

**Implications for Story:**
- Marcus left evidence that the prediction model has limits
- Meta-investigation: Kael trying to act unpredictably while being predicted
- Antagonists: Optimization Authority + Cortex/Meridian/Nexus consortium
- Victory condition: Prove the model can be broken? Become genuinely unpredictable?

## MANAGER'S ASSESSMENT

**Strongest narrative fit:** Option C (Memory Archive) — most directly serves the theme and creates the most personal stakes for Kael. The idea that Marcus left him breadcrumbs to *remember his own life* is devastating.

**Most plausible/grounded:** Option B (Autonomy Erosion) — requires the least new technology and maps directly to present anxieties. Marcus's auditor role fits perfectly.

**Most visceral:** Option A (Attenuation) — physical implants create tangible threat and clear investigation targets. The detail that victims don't want to be saved is excellent.

**Most ambitious:** Option D (Prediction Machine) — philosophically rich but risks being too abstract. Could work if combined with elements from another option.

**Possible hybrid:** Options A and C share neural-implant infrastructure. Could combine: the implants enable both preference engineering AND memory editing, discovered in phases (Act II: Attenuation, Act III: Memory Archive reveals full scope).
