# Inciting Incident Pitch: The Automated Executor
## Agent: Message Approach

## THE SCENE

A scheduled data-sync alert pings Kael's navigation system — something routed through a dead-drop server, the kind he and Marcus set up fifteen years ago as a joke. "In case we ever actually need it," Marcus had said. They never did.

The message is four kilobytes of compressed financial records. No note, no sign-off. Just data. The file timestamp is marked exactly seven days after Marcus's official death date.

Kael doesn't open it immediately. He doesn't even think about Marcus consciously — that's not how his mind works. But it sits there, occupying space. A violation of the silence.

Over the next two days, it nags at him in the way only forgotten things can.

He finally cracks it. The patterns are immediate: money flowing backward through shell companies. Timestamps. Names. All of it pointing to something systematic. Nothing that screams urgency. Nothing that demands action. But written in a style he recognizes — Marcus's methodical clinical notation. The handwriting of someone cataloging evidence.

## WHY THIS WORKS

**Respects who Kael is:** Marcus doesn't *call* for help. He doesn't send a desperate message begging Kael to "look into this." He simply leaves the data in a place only Kael would know to find it — not because he expected Kael to act, but because Marcus knew Kael would have to *understand* why he couldn't stay silent.

**No demand, just trust:** The kind of friendship that survives twenty years of silence because it was built on knowing, not talking.

**Subtle urgency:** The message exists *because* Marcus is gone. Kael might ignore a cry for help. But he can't ignore proof that Marcus reached out one last time by doing exactly what Marcus would do — leaving the work unfinished, waiting for someone who actually cared enough to finish it.

**The crack:** Kael's detachment fractures not because he's inspired or heroic, but because the one person who understood him trusted him to understand what this meant.
