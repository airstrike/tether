# Inciting Incident Pitch: The Algorithm Audit
## Agent: Platform Regulation Approach

## THE NEWS STORY

**"Senate Committee Kills Algorithmic Transparency Bill 11-9."**

Both sides are screaming:
- Progressive outlets: corporate capture, tech lobbyists buying votes
- Conservative feeds: victory against government overreach, protecting innovation

Standard partisan theater.

## THE INCONSISTENCY

Except the vote breakdown doesn't track.

Kael scrolls through the names:
- Three Democrats who voted to kill it are the same senators who co-sponsored it six months ago
- Two Republicans who killed it have spent years railing against Big Tech censorship

The inconsistency isn't partisan — it's *patterned*. Like someone needed this bill dead and didn't care which side they bought to do it.

He pulls the campaign finance data. Same five senators, different donors, but when he traces the shell companies backward through the public filings, they converge.

All roads lead to a holding company called **Asymptote Media Partners**. No products. No platform. Just capital, flowing into opposite causes.

## THE CONNECTION TO MARCUS

Three screens down on the same feed: a small item, already vanishing into the churn.

**"Federal auditor Marcus Oyelaran found dead in New Francisco apartment. Preliminary investigation rules suicide."**

No foul play. No note. Just another casualty of burnout culture, processed and filed.

The article mentions his work briefly — something about ad spending audits, financial compliance in the attention economy. The kind of detail that gets buried because no one cares about the accountants.

But Kael does the math:
- Six months ago, Marcus filed a request for subpoena authority to investigate irregularities in federal ad contracts
- The request was denied
- Two weeks later, three of the bill's co-sponsors flipped their votes
- Now the bill is dead, and so is Marcus

Not dramatic. Just gone.

## THE SCENE

The Kepler Station feed is cycling through the usual noise when a headline catches Kael's eye: **"Senate Committee Kills Algorithmic Transparency Bill 11-9."** Both sides are screaming. Progressive outlets are calling it corporate capture, tech lobbyists buying votes to keep their black boxes hidden. Conservative feeds are celebrating it as a victory against government overreach, protecting innovation from regulatory stranglehold. Standard partisan theater.

Except the vote breakdown doesn't track. Kael scrolls through the names: three Democrats who voted to kill it are the same senators who co-sponsored it six months ago. Two Republicans who killed it have spent years railing against Big Tech censorship. The inconsistency isn't partisan — it's *patterned*. Like someone needed this bill dead and didn't care which side they bought to do it. He pulls the campaign finance data. Same five senators, different donors, but when he traces the shell companies backward through the public filings, they converge. All roads lead to a holding company called Asymptote Media Partners.

Two weeks later, three of the bill's co-sponsors flipped their votes. Now the bill is dead, and so is Marcus. Not dramatic. Just gone. The pattern-recognition part of Kael's brain — the part that kept him alive in deep space for twenty years — locks onto it like a targeting system. Marcus wasn't investigating tech regulation. He was investigating the money *behind* tech regulation. And someone made sure both the auditor and the audit died quietly.
