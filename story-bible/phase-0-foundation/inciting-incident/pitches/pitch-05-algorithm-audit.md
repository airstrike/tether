## THE PITCH

The Kepler Station feed is cycling through the usual noise when a headline catches Kael's eye: **"Senate Committee Kills Algorithmic Transparency Bill 11-9."** Both sides are screaming. Progressive outlets are calling it corporate capture, tech lobbyists buying votes to keep their black boxes hidden. Conservative feeds are celebrating it as a victory against government overreach, protecting innovation from regulatory stranglehold. Standard partisan theater.

Except the vote breakdown doesn't track. Kael scrolls through the names: three Democrats who voted to kill it are the same senators who co-sponsored it six months ago. Two Republicans who killed it have spent years railing against Big Tech censorship. The inconsistency isn't partisan — it's *patterned*. Like someone needed this bill dead and didn't care which side they bought to do it. He pulls the campaign finance data. Same five senators, different donors, but when he traces the shell companies backward through the public filings, they converge. All roads lead to a holding company called Asymptote Media Partners. No products. No platform. Just capital, flowing into opposite causes.

Three screens down on the same feed: a small item, already vanishing into the churn. **"Federal auditor Marcus Oyelaran found dead in New Francisco apartment. Preliminary investigation rules suicide."** No foul play. No note. Just another casualty of burnout culture, processed and filed. The article mentions his work briefly — something about ad spending audits, financial compliance in the attention economy. It's the kind of detail that gets buried because no one cares about the accountants.

But Kael does the math. Six months ago, Marcus filed a request for subpoena authority to investigate irregularities in federal ad contracts. The request was denied. Two weeks later, three of the bill's co-sponsors flipped their votes. Now the bill is dead, and so is Marcus. Not dramatic. Just gone. The pattern-recognition part of Kael's brain — the part that kept him alive in deep space for twenty years — locks onto it like a targeting system. Marcus wasn't investigating tech regulation. He was investigating the money behind tech regulation. And someone made sure both the auditor and the audit died quietly.

## WHY THIS WORKS

**Respects the audience's intelligence:** No exposition dump. Kael sees the vote breakdown, recognizes the anomaly, traces the money. The audience follows his logic without hand-holding.

**Specific, grounded news story:** The Algorithmic Transparency Bill is the kind of legislation that would actually exist in this world — high-profile culture war fodder that both sides can weaponize.

**The inconsistency is investigable:** Campaign finance data is public. Shell companies can be traced. The conspiracy reveals itself through Kael's natural process of elimination.

**Marcus emerges organically:** He's not the main story. He's a footnote. That's what makes it horrifying. The system killed him casually, as a maintenance task.

**Kael's pattern-recognition drives it:** He doesn't get emotional. He doesn't mourn. He just sees the shape of the thing and can't unsee it.

**Sets up Asymptote Media Partners:** The conspiracy isn't abstract. It has a name, a structure, a financial trail. Kael now knows where to start digging.

## THE EMOTIONAL BEAT

Kael stares at Marcus's name in the small article. He hasn't thought about Marcus in years. But he remembers the last conversation they had — something about how the only people who still mattered were the ones who weren't performing for an audience. Marcus was right. And now he's dead, erased from the story, reduced to two paragraphs about workplace stress. The bill dies the same day Marcus's death is ruled a suicide. Convenient.

Kael doesn't feel anger. He feels *recognition*. The same system that made him flee to space just cleaned up a loose end. And no one's asking why.
