# Inciting Incident Pitch: Echo Protocol
## Agent: Routine/Tradition Approach

---

## THE TRIGGER

Kael's ship systems log a recurring alert — a message repeatedly attempting to reach him across an encrypted channel he hasn't monitored in fifteen years.

It's not active contact, just a dead-drop protocol he and Marcus set up during a conversation about paranoia, back when they were young enough to joke about needing untraceable dead zones.

The alert keeps cycling: *"If this triggers, I'm probably already gone. Follow the breadcrumbs. You'll understand why."*

The message is timestamped two months old.

When Kael tries to respond, the channel collapses — manually terminated from Earth side. Someone cleaned it up. But not quite thoroughly enough.

## THE DISCOVERY

Kael runs a routine social trace — not obsession, just basic digging — to find out what happened to Marcus.

What surfaces is wrong in a way that feels deliberate.

Official records show suicide six weeks ago, clean narrative, tied up documents, memorial already processed. But the timestamps don't align. The death certificate predates when the message was sent.

And then Kael finds something worse: Marcus was erased from three separate work databases entirely — his name redacted from projects, his access records deleted, even his performance reviews scrubbed.

It's not the work of grieving bureaucrats. It's the work of someone trying to make sure nobody traced what Marcus was looking at when he died.

The casualness of it — just another name lost in the system's noise — is what makes it hit hardest. Not murdered dramatically. Just... removed. Like he never mattered enough to matter at all.

## WHY THIS WORKS

- **Organic trigger:** The dead-drop protocol feels lived-in — a detail that proves they had a relationship that mattered, even if it was never intimate
- **Reflects faded friendship:** They set this up, then never used it. Kael forgot about it. It's the ghost of connection, not active love.
- **Subtle urgency:** Not a dramatic deathbed call, but a message sent into the void, hoping someone was still listening
- **Casualness hits hard:** The real damage isn't the death — it's the erasure. Marcus isn't just dead. He's been scrubbed.
