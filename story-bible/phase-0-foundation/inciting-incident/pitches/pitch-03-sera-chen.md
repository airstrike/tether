# Inciting Incident Pitch: Dr. Sera Chen
## Agent: Mutual Contact Approach

---

## THE CONTACT

Sera Chen was Marcus's mentor during his early days at the Federal Audit Bureau — the one person inside government who taught him how to follow money trails without triggering surveillance flags.

They lost touch years ago when Sera took early retirement after a stress-related breakdown. Official story: burnout. Real story: she saw too much and decided the cost of caring was higher than her pension.

## THE SCENE

Kael receives an encrypted message on a dead-drop forum he hasn't checked in seven years.

Just three sentences, from an anonymous account bearing Sera's old handler number:

*"Marcus is dead. I'm the reason you need to know why. If you still have his emails from 2019, read the one with subject line ASYMPTOTE MEMORANDA before anyone deletes them from your archives. We have maybe 72 hours."*

Kael's first instinct is to delete it. Anonymous contact. Urgency play. Classic social engineering.

But the handler number is real — only three people ever knew it, and Marcus was one of them. The fact that it surfaces now, this way, means either Sera has been monitoring Kael's ghost accounts for years, or she's desperate enough to break cover on a cold trail.

## THE REACTION

Kael doesn't immediately hunt down Marcus. Instead, he does what isolation taught him: he verifies.

He checks the forum archives. The message is real.

He runs a forensic scan on his old email server — a failsafe Marcus insisted on before they went dark. The file is there, dated 2019, encrypted under a key Kael thought was destroyed.

For the first time in twenty years, Kael has two simultaneous problems: someone knows he exists, and someone is betting his conscience is worth breaking his exile for.

He reads the email.

## WHY THIS WORKS

- **Credible contact:** Sera has reason to know both Marcus and Kael, and reason to reach out now (preservation, not sentiment)
- **Urgency without melodrama:** "72 hours" isn't a bomb threat, it's a practical timeline (evidence deletion, surveillance gaps)
- **Breaks isolation:** This isn't someone finding Kael — it's proof someone *was monitoring him all along*
- **Forces verification:** Kael can verify independently, which is exactly what someone like him would do
- **Introduces a supporting character:** Sera is already broken by the system, making one last move from the sidelines
