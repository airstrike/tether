# THE INCITING INCIDENT

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Kael sees a news story about a moderate candidate (Vanessa Locke) destroyed by coordinated attacks from both sides. He's not investigating — he's just tired. Mad at himself for clicking on it, hoping something had changed. It hasn't.

Then, buried in the feed: a small story. "Federal auditor dies in apartment fire. Twin sister survived."

There aren't many auditors with twin sisters in New Francisco.

Oh shit. It's Marcus.

180 the ship. Set course for Earth. Opening credits.

## THE SCENE

### Part 1: The Backdrop (Vanessa Locke)

Kael is docked at a station — routine stop, fuel and supplies. A news feed cycles in the background. He's not watching, but something catches his eye:

**"Independent Candidate Locke Suspends Campaign Amid Funding Scandal"**

Both sides are running the story:
- Progressive feeds: "Dark money fraud exposed"
- Conservative feeds: "Woke technocrat caught in donor web"

Same footage. Opposite villains. The whole machine churning.

Kael clicks on it — and immediately regrets it. He's almost mad at himself. Did he really think something would be different? That after twenty years, Earth would've figured it out?

Nothing's changed. The same bullshit. The same performance. The same people screaming at each other while someone profits from the noise.

He closes the story. Doesn't investigate. Doesn't care. Just another reminder of why he left.

### Part 2: The Hook (Marcus)

He scrolls past the political noise. Station updates. Shipping manifests. The usual churn.

Then, six stories down, a small item:

**"Federal Auditor Dies in New Francisco Apartment Fire. Twin Sister Survived."**

Kael stops.

There aren't many federal auditors in New Francisco. There's only one he knows of with a twin sister.

He pulls up the article. No name in the headline. Just "auditor" — the kind of anonymous death that gets processed and forgotten. But the details are there if you're looking: Federal Accounts Division. New Francisco district. Apartment fire, cause under investigation. Sister was home, escaped with minor injuries.

Marcus.

### Part 3: The Decision

Kael doesn't hesitate. Doesn't think it through. Doesn't weigh the costs.

He's already moving.

The Liminal was minutes from undocking — course set for the outer stations, weeks of quiet ahead. Now he's at the nav console, canceling the route, plotting a new one.

Earth.

The ship pivots. The station shrinks behind him. The engines kick to full burn.

**Opening credits. Music score amps up.**

The Liminal storms past the docking station at full speed, burning toward a planet Kael swore he'd never see again.

## WHY THIS WORKS

### The Backdrop Does Its Job
The Vanessa Locke story isn't the hook — it's the *context*. It shows the world Kael left: still broken, still performing, still churning. His tired reaction establishes his exhausted clarity. He's not a crusader. He's just someone who's seen enough.

### The Hook Is Indirect
Marcus's death isn't announced to Kael. He finds it himself, buried in the noise. The story doesn't even mention Marcus by name — just "auditor" and "twin sister." Kael has to make the connection. This respects the audience's intelligence and makes the discovery feel earned.

### The Twin Sister
Marcus has a twin sister who survived. She's:
- A reason for Kael to go to Earth (someone to find, to question)
- A witness to Marcus's final days
- Potentially a supporting character
- Proof that Marcus had a life beyond his friendship with Kael

### Fire, Not Suicide
The official story is apartment fire, not suicide. This is:
- More ambiguous (accident? arson? cover-up?)
- Gives Kael something to investigate
- Allows the truth to be uncovered in layers

### The Immediate Turn
No hesitation. No weighing options. Kael just *goes*.

This isn't a calculated decision — it's instinct. The only person who understood him is dead, and the story doesn't add up. Everything else — the life he built, the solitude he earned — becomes irrelevant.

The opening credits hit as he burns for Earth. The music tells us: this is where the story really begins.

## WHAT WE'VE ESTABLISHED

1. **Marcus is dead** — officially, an apartment fire
2. **Marcus has a twin sister** — she survived, she's in New Francisco
3. **The world is still broken** — Vanessa Locke's destruction is just backdrop
4. **Kael's reaction is immediate** — no deliberation, just action
5. **The investigation starts on Earth** — find the sister, find the truth

---

## NOTES FOR LATER DEVELOPMENT

- **The twin sister needs a name and character** — she'll be significant
- **The fire needs investigation** — what really happened?
- **Vanessa Locke's story** — this connects to the conspiracy, will resurface in Act II
- **Marcus's final days** — what was he working on? What did the sister see?
