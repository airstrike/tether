## Data Keys

Hardware encryption keys. Press with thumb pressure to activate NFC, tap to authenticate. Data lives elsewhere - cloud, remote servers, local drives - all encrypted. The key is what lets you read/write to it. Without the key, no access.

Most people carry them openly, like a wallet. Many people have multiple keys - one for everyday stuff, another for a private stash, backup keys stored safely somewhere else in case of emergency. From the outside, all keys look the same. A thief can't tell if they're stealing your life savings or your grocery list.

**Disguised keys:** Hiding a data key (in a bracelet, contact lens case, etc.) is something you do if you're cautious or have something to protect.

**Kael's key:** Mounted in his bracelet. He likes to be careful.

**Marcus's key:** Kael gave Marcus one disguised as a contact lens case - partly a joke (2-for-1 deal, Marcus stubbornly wore glasses), partly wanting his friend to be safe. Marcus kept it. This becomes important in later episodes when Kael needs to access whatever Marcus encrypted.
