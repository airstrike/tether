- Meets Marcus's twin sister **Elara Oyelaran** at the hospital
- Searches Marcus's burned apartment — finds hidden data cache
- First breadcrumbs: Marcus was investigating something about money
- **Hook:** Someone accessed Marcus's work terminal in real-time. "Someone knows we're looking."

**Characters Introduced:** Riven Gale (The Fixer)

---

### EPISODE 4: "The Scope"
**Main Question:** How deep does this go?

- Cold open: The Investors' compound — parents discussing "handling" the Oyelaran situation. Children play without screens.
- Kael protects Elara (moved to safehouse)
- Meets **Dr. Yuki Salazar** (The Whistleblower) — former Asymptote analyst
- Yuki explains: Asymptote invests in conflict itself. Both sides funded.
- Kael tries to go public — journalist refuses (legal threats, systemic suffocation)
- **MIDPOINT REVELATION:** The Investors aren't hidden. They're public figures. The system is invisible because everyone's looking at it.
- **Hook:** Mystery contact: "The Investors are meeting. Marcus planned to be there. Meet me tomorrow."

**Characters Introduced:** Dr. Yuki Salazar (Whistleblower), The Investors (glimpsed)

---

### EPISODE 5: "Faith Enough"
**Main Question:** Can Kael work with people who still believe?

- Cold open: Resistance cell meeting — idealistic, organized, naive
- Kael meets **Vera Khatri** (The True Believer) — former campaign manager, still has hope
- The resistance has resources, connections, a plan to expose The Investors
- Kael's detachment vs. their idealism — philosophical conflict
- Whistleblower **Isabel Quan** agrees to testify
- Building momentum toward real exposure
- **Hook:** Federal raid. The resistance is arrested. The Investors knew everything. They were watching the whole time.

**Characters Introduced:** Vera Khatri (True Believer), Isabel Quan (secondary whistleblower)

---

### EPISODE 6: "The Gravity Well"
**Main Question:** What's left when everything collapses?

- Cold open: Kael in custody, interrogated, released — they want him to lead them to the data
- Resistance in federal custody, charges pending
- **Director Chen** (Investor face) offers Kael a clean exit: give up Isabel, walk away
- **The betrayal:** Isabel's data was compromised — she was coerced to protect her family
- Desperate raid to retrieve original files — captured
- **ALL IS LOST:** Kael has nothing. Ship tracked. Sister in danger. Evidence gone.
- **Hook:** Isabel whispers: "I sent copies. Dead-drops. Timed release. I don't know if it worked."

**Characters Introduced:** Director Chen (Investor face)

---

### EPISODE 7: "The Witness"
**Main Question:** Will Kael disappear or choose to bear witness?

- Cold open: Kael alone in a safehouse. Could leave right now. Nobody would know.
- Voice-over-comms with Elara: She found Marcus's dead man's switch — needs someone to activate it
- **The Old Spacer** returns — a mirror for Kael. "Same reason you're about to stay."
- Kael on The Liminal — could leave. Remembers Marcus. "Someone has to."
- Assembles the fixers — pays everything he has to distribute the data
- Final in-person meeting with Elara — they activate Marcus's dead man's switch together
- Data goes live across a hundred platforms
- **Hook:** Message from The Investors: "You've made yourself interesting. Let's talk."

**Character Returns:** The Old Spacer, Elara (final in-person)

---

### EPISODE 8: "The Machine"
**Main Question:** Can Kael survive bearing witness?

- Cold open: Kael in penthouse with **The Face** (Investor representative). "It won't matter."
- **THE PHILOSOPHICAL CONFRONTATION:** The Face doesn't deny anything. Just argues the system works as designed.
- "We didn't break democracy. We monetized it."
- Kael: "I'm not here to break it. Just to make sure someone saw it."
- The offer: Disappear with compensation, or face systemic consequences
- Kael refuses
- **THE COST:** Accounts frozen, ship impounded, trapped on Earth
- Character returns: True Believer (resistance organizing), Elara (leaving for off-world), Old Spacer (silent acknowledgment)
- Marcus's final message: "Don't come back for me. Just remember I tried."
- **ENDING:** Kael works dockside labor. The Believer offers him a place in the resistance. Kael doesn't answer.
- **Final image:** Either Kael joins the quiet work of resistance, or walks toward an unknown choice (ambiguous)

**Resolution:** The machine continues. But the truth is visible. Someone witnessed. And that's enough.

## THEMATIC THROUGHLINE

**"Connected but not loving"** → **"Someone has to"**

- Ep 1-2: The world is optimized for engagement, starved for presence
- Ep 3-4: The conspiracy profits from division, eliminates authenticity
- Ep 5-6: Even hope and resistance can be captured
- Ep 7-8: Witnessing isn't victory, but it's not nothing

The ending doesn't save the world. It proves that someone saw it, named it, and refused to be silent.

---

## DECISIONS STILL NEEDED

1. **Kael's fate:** Survives but trapped? Dies? Ambiguous?
2. **Character names:** Some supporting cast still need final names
3. **The Investors:** How many faces? What personalities?
4. **Vanessa Locke:** Does she return later? Or just backdrop?
5. **The Old Spacer:** More development? Name?
