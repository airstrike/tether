# EPISODE 1: "The Liminal"

## 1. TITLE CONCEPT

**"The Liminal"**

The title works on three levels:
- Literal: The name of Kael's ship
- Thematic: Kael exists in liminal space between caring and not caring
- Structural: This episode is the threshold between his old life and what's coming

---

## 2. COLD OPEN (Pre-Credits)

**LOCATION:** Kael's ship, The Liminal, docked at Tycho Station (lunar orbit)

**RUNTIME:** 3-4 minutes

**THE SCENE:**

INT. THE LIMINAL - CARGO BAY - DAY

The ship is small, functional, meticulously maintained. Not pristine—lived-in. Twenty years of solitude compressed into organized efficiency. Everything has a place.

Kael Vasaro (mid-40s, weathered but not broken) is running post-docking checks. Routine. Mechanical. He's done this a thousand times.

A newsfeed cycles on a monitor in the background—station announcements, shipping manifests, the usual noise. Kael isn't watching. He's checking fuel lines, cargo manifests, next destination coordinates.

Then something on the feed catches his eye. He doesn't react immediately. Just... stops moving.

ON SCREEN: Split-screen coverage. Two different news sources showing the same footage.

**HEADLINE (Progressive Feed):** "Independent Candidate Locke Suspends Campaign — Dark Money Fraud Exposed"

**HEADLINE (Conservative Feed):** "Vanessa Locke Abandons Race After Donor Scandal"

Same video. Different villains. The coordinated destruction of a moderate playing out in real-time.

Kael watches for ten seconds. His face doesn't move, but something flickers—recognition, exhaustion, maybe disgust. He reaches for the screen to close it.

Then stops.

Scrolls down instead. Past the political circus. Past station updates. Past shipping news.

Six stories down, a small item. Local news from Earth. New Francisco district.

**HEADLINE:** "Federal Auditor Dies in Apartment Fire. Twin Sister Survived."

Kael goes completely still.

He taps the article. Scans it. No name in the headline, just "auditor"—the kind of anonymous death that gets processed and forgotten. But the details are there: Federal Accounts Division. New Francisco. Fire, cause under investigation. Twin sister escaped with minor injuries.

Kael's jaw tightens.

CUT TO:

INT. THE LIMINAL - COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

Kael is already moving. He drops into the pilot's seat, pulls up nav systems. The ship was set to undock in five minutes—course plotted for the outer rim. Weeks of quiet. Months of solitude.

He cancels it.

New destination: Earth.

The undocking clamps release. The Liminal pulls away from Tycho Station.

Kael guns the engines. The station shrinks behind him. The blue marble of Earth fills the viewport.

He hasn't been back in twenty years.

**SMASH TO BLACK.**

**TITLE CARD: TETHER**

**OPENING CREDITS SEQUENCE**

Music: Something sparse, industrial, tense. Visuals: The Liminal burning through space. Glimpses of Earth getting closer. Maybe fragments of news coverage—the divided world Kael is returning to.

---

## 3. MAIN DRAMATIC QUESTION

**"Why did Marcus die?"**

This episode establishes the investigation's stakes and Kael's relationship to it. The question isn't just intellectual—it's personal. Marcus was the last person who knew Kael before he left. The last connection that wasn't transactional.

By the end of the episode, Kael (and the audience) will have one answer: it wasn't an accident. But that answer opens ten more questions.

---

## 4. KEY SCENES

### SCENE A: Descent (Post-Credits)

**LOCATION:** The Liminal, atmospheric entry to Earth

**PURPOSE:** Establish Kael's estrangement from Earth. Twenty years away. The sensory overload of return.

The ship shakes as it hits atmosphere. Kael's hands are steady on the controls—he's done this before, just not here, not in two decades.

Through the viewport: the sprawl of New Francisco. Bigger than he remembers. Brighter. More chaotic. The city has metastasized.

Kael's face registers nothing, but his knuckles are white on the flight stick.

**DIALOGUE (internal monologue or minimal voiceover):**
"Twenty years. I told myself I'd never come back. Told myself there was nothing here worth the noise."

The Liminal touches down at a public landing field. Kael sits in the cockpit for a long moment before moving.

---

### SCENE B: New Francisco (The Sensory Assault)

**LOCATION:** Public landing field, New Francisco spaceport district

**PURPOSE:** Contrast Kael's solitude with Earth's chaos. Establish the world's condition—fractured, loud, algorithmically curated.

Kael steps off the ship. The noise hits him first. Crowds. Advertisements projected on every surface. News feeds cycling—different stations, different narratives, all screaming at once.

A public screen shows Vanessa Locke's face. The story is still cycling. "Locke refuses to comment on allegations..." Different channels, different spins.

Kael moves through the crowd. People glued to personal devices. No one makes eye contact. No one talks to each other. Just the hum of a million isolated individuals occupying the same space.

He pauses at a transit kiosk. Buys a ticket using a credit account he hasn't touched in twenty years. The system recognizes him immediately.

**KIOSK (automated voice):** "Welcome back, Kael Vasaro. Last transaction: 2006. Your social credit score is... unavailable. Proceeding with standard fare."

Kael doesn't react. Just takes the ticket and keeps moving.

---

### SCENE C: The Sister (First Contact)

**LOCATION:** New Francisco Memorial Hospital, recovery wing

**PURPOSE:** Introduce Marcus's sister. Establish the emotional hook. Give Kael a reason to stay.

Kael finds her in the recovery wing. Not an intensive care room—just a standard post-treatment suite. She's sitting by the window, wrapped in a hospital robe, staring out at the city. Her hands are bandaged. Smoke inhalation burns on her neck.

She looks exactly like Marcus. Same bone structure. Same eyes. But where Marcus was warm, she's sharp. Guarded.

Kael stops in the doorway. She doesn't turn around.

**SISTER:** "You're late."

**KAEL:** "Didn't know I was expected."

**SISTER:** "Marcus talked about you. Said if anything happened to him, you'd show up."

She turns to face him. Her eyes scan him—not hostile, just assessing.

**SISTER:** "Took you four days."

**KAEL:** "I was twenty million kilometers out. I came as fast as I could."

She studies him for another moment, then nods.

**SISTER:** "He always said you were the one person who'd actually give a shit."

**KAEL:** "What happened?"

**SISTER:** "They said it was an electrical fire. Faulty wiring. The building was old."

**KAEL:** "You believe that?"

Long pause.

**SISTER:** "No."

---

### SCENE D: The Apartment (The Crime Scene)

**LOCATION:** Marcus's apartment building, New Francisco, Sector 7

**PURPOSE:** Establish the investigation. Show Kael's competence. Plant evidence that something is wrong.

The building is sealed with safety tape, but no one's guarding it. Budget cuts. Understaffed city services. The fire was two weeks ago. No one cares anymore.

Kael and the Sister slip inside.

The apartment is gutted. Blackened walls. Melted furniture. The smell of burnt synthetics still hangs in the air.

Kael moves through the space methodically. The Sister hangs back, watching.

**SISTER:** "The fire started in his office. That's what they said."

Kael steps into what's left of the office. The desk is a blackened skeleton. The terminal is slag.

But something's wrong.

Kael crouches by the desk. Runs his hand along the floor. Stops at a section of floorboard that's less damaged than the rest.

He pries it up.

Underneath: a fire-resistant data cache. Small, ruggedized. The kind of thing someone hides on purpose.

Kael pulls it out. Turns it over in his hands. Sealed. Locked.

**KAEL:** "Marcus didn't die in an accident."

**SISTER:** "How do you know?"

**KAEL:** "Because he was ready for it."

---

### SCENE E: The Encrypted Files (The Hook Deepens)

**LOCATION:** The Liminal, docked at landing field

**PURPOSE:** Reveal what Marcus was investigating. Escalate the stakes.

Kael cracks the data cache. It takes him six hours. The Sister watches from the co-pilot seat, saying nothing.

When the files decrypt, the screen fills with spreadsheets, transaction records, network diagrams. Marcus's notes overlay everything.

**ON SCREEN:**

- Campaign finance records
- PAC donation networks
- Shell company registrations
- Names highlighted in red

**MARCUS'S NOTES (text overlays):**
"Same investors. Both sides. Follow the money."
"Asymptote Media Partners—holding company. No public info."
"Vanessa Locke—targeted. Systematic."

Kael scrolls through the files. Stops on a video file. Clicks it.

Marcus's face fills the screen. Recorded weeks before the fire. He looks tired. Scared.

**MARCUS (on recording):** "If you're watching this, I'm probably dead. And Kael, if it's you... I'm sorry. I didn't mean to drag you back into this."

He pauses. Rubs his face.

**MARCUS:** "I found something. A pattern. The money that funds progressives? It's the same money funding the right. Not some of it. All of it. Same offshore accounts. Same investors. They're not picking sides. They're funding the fight itself."

Another pause.

**MARCUS:** "I tried to go through channels. Filed reports. Contacted oversight. Nothing happened. Then someone contacted me. Told me to stop. Offered me money. When I refused, things got... difficult."

He looks directly into the camera.

**MARCUS:** "Kael, if you're seeing this, don't try to finish what I started. It's too big. Too connected. Just... make sure Sera's safe. Please."

The video ends.

Kael sits in silence.

The Sister (now revealed as SERA) is crying quietly.

**KAEL:** "He asked me to keep you safe."

**SERA:** "I don't want safe. I want to know who killed him."

**KAEL:** "Those might be the same thing."

**SERA:** "I don't care."

Kael looks at her. Sees Marcus in her face. The same stubbornness. The same refusal to look away.

**KAEL:** "Alright."

---

### SCENE F: The First Thread (Asymptote Media Partners)

**LOCATION:** Public records terminal, city archive building

**PURPOSE:** Begin the investigation. Show Kael and Sera working together.

They're in a sterile government building, accessing public corporate filings. The interface is deliberately obtuse—bureaucratic obstruction baked into the system.

Sera navigates it effortlessly. She's done this before.

**SERA:** "Marcus taught me. Said you always start with public records. People hide in plain sight because they think no one's looking."

They pull up Asymptote Media Partners. The corporate structure is a maze—shell companies, offshore registrations, beneficial ownership hidden behind layers of legal entities.

But Marcus left breadcrumbs in his files. Sera cross-references them.

One name surfaces. Connected to three different holding companies. Board member at two media conglomerates. Donor to PACs on opposite ends of the spectrum.

**ON SCREEN:** "Elias Horne—Managing Director, Asymptote Capital Group"

**SERA:** "Marcus had this name flagged. Who is he?"

Kael pulls up a public profile. Elias Horne: financier, philanthropist, tech investor. Smiling photo from a charity gala. Clean reputation. No scandals.

**KAEL:** "Someone who doesn't want to be noticed."

**SERA:** "So what do we do?"

**KAEL:** "We make him notice us."

---

## 5. NEW CHARACTERS INTRODUCED

### SERA OYELARAN (Marcus's Twin Sister)

**AGE:** Late 30s

**OCCUPATION:** Data analyst, freelance (used to work government contracts, now private sector)

**PERSONALITY:**
- Sharp, guarded, competent
- Grief manifests as anger and focus
- Physically intimate with Kael later in the episode (not shown in detail, but implied in final scene)
- Not a damsel—active participant in the investigation
- Knows how to navigate bureaucratic systems
- Skeptical of institutions but still believes in accountability

**RELATIONSHIP TO KAEL:**
- Recognizes him from Marcus's stories
- Trusts him because Marcus did
- Physical connection develops quickly (survival instinct, shared grief)
- But both understand it's not love—it's proximity and need

**ARC:** Starts as grieving sister, becomes co-investigator, eventually transitions to voice-over-comms support as danger escalates.

---

### MARCUS OYELARAN (Deceased, but Present)

**SEEN IN:** Recorded video message, photographs, Sera's memories

**ESTABLISHED:**
- Federal auditor, meticulous and principled
- Investigated financial irregularities, followed the money
- Knew he was in danger, prepared for it
- Asked Kael to protect Sera, not to avenge him
- Was one of the last people who knew "before" Kael—the version who still cared

---

### ELIAS HORNE (First Mention Only)

**ESTABLISHED:**
- Managing Director, Asymptote Capital Group
- Connected to multiple shell companies and PACs
- Public persona: respectable financier and philanthropist
- Marcus flagged him as part of the pattern
- Will become a face of the conspiracy in later episodes

---

## 6. INVESTIGATION PROGRESS (What Kael Learns)

### What Kael Knows by End of Episode:

1. **Marcus's death wasn't an accident** — He had a hidden data cache, recorded a warning video, and was prepared for danger.

2. **Marcus was investigating campaign finance irregularities** — Same money funding opposite political movements. Donations traced to offshore holding companies.

3. **A pattern exists** — The elimination of moderate candidates (like Vanessa Locke) isn't organic. It's systematic.

4. **Asymptote Media Partners is key** — A holding company with no public profile, connected to PACs across the political spectrum.

5. **Elias Horne is a starting point** — One name in a larger network. A face to investigate.

6. **Sera is a competent partner** — She knows how to navigate systems, and she's not backing down.

### What Kael Doesn't Know Yet:

- Who specifically killed Marcus (or ordered his death)
- How big the conspiracy is
- What the endgame looks like
- Whether he can actually accomplish anything

---

## 7. EMOTIONAL THROUGHLINE (How Kael Changes)

### START OF EPISODE:
Kael is detached, exhausted, resigned. He left Earth because he couldn't stand the performance and chaos. He built a life in solitude and made peace with it. Marcus's death is a rupture—not because it changes his worldview, but because it demands a response he didn't think he'd have to give.

### MIDDLE OF EPISODE:
Kael is moving on instinct. He's not hopeful, not crusading. He's just... doing the next thing. Meeting Sera. Searching the apartment. Cracking the data cache. Each action is mechanical, not emotional.

But Sera's presence starts to crack something. She's Marcus's mirror. She refuses to let it go. And Kael recognizes something in her—the same stubbornness that kept Marcus digging when everyone told him to stop.

### END OF EPISODE:
Kael hasn't transformed. He's not suddenly hopeful or righteous. But he's made a choice. He's staying. He's investigating. Not because he believes it'll fix anything, but because Marcus asked him to protect Sera, and the only way to do that is to finish what Marcus started.

The physical intimacy with Sera (implied in the final scene) underscores the theme: connection is possible, but it's not enough. They're two people using each other for comfort, and both know it. But it's still more than isolation.

### THE SHIFT:
From "I don't want to be here" to "I'm here, so I might as well do something."

Not hope. Just grim obligation.

---

## 8. CLIFFHANGER/HOOK (Why We Watch Episode 2)

**FINAL SCENE:**

INT. THE LIMINAL - SLEEPING QUARTERS - NIGHT

Kael and Sera are lying in the narrow bunk. Not cuddling—just occupying the same space. The physical is over. Now it's just two exhausted people in the dark.

Sera's looking at the ceiling. Kael's eyes are closed, but he's not asleep.

**SERA:** "You don't think we can win, do you?"

**KAEL:** "No."

**SERA:** "Then why are you doing this?"

Long pause.

**KAEL:** "Because someone has to."

Sera turns her head to look at him. Studies his face.

**SERA:** "Marcus was right about you."

**KAEL:** "What did he say?"

**SERA:** "That you were the only person he knew who'd see the world for what it was and still show up."

Kael opens his eyes. Looks at her.

**KAEL:** "He was wrong. I ran."

**SERA:** "But you came back."

Before Kael can respond, Sera's comm device buzzes. She picks it up. Frowns.

**SERA:** "Someone just accessed Marcus's old work terminal. From inside the Federal Accounts building."

**KAEL:** "When?"

**SERA:** "Right now."

Kael sits up.

**KAEL:** "Someone knows we're looking."

**SMASH TO BLACK.**

**END EPISODE 1.**

---

# EPISODE 2: "The Pattern"

## 1. TITLE CONCEPT

**"The Pattern"**

The title reflects the episode's focus: Kael and Sera start to see the shape of the conspiracy. Individual data points connect. What looked like isolated corruption becomes a system. The "pattern" Marcus discovered begins to reveal itself.

It's also a reference to how investigations work—you don't see the truth all at once. You see fragments, and then suddenly the pattern emerges.

---

## 2. COLD OPEN (Pre-Credits)

**LOCATION:** Federal Accounts Building, New Francisco, 2:47 AM

**RUNTIME:** 3-4 minutes

**THE SCENE:**

INT. FEDERAL ACCOUNTS BUILDING - MARCUS'S OLD OFFICE - NIGHT

The building is empty. Security lights cast long shadows. The only sound is the hum of HVAC systems.

A figure moves through the corridor. Not sneaking—walking with the confidence of someone who belongs. They swipe a keycard. The lock disengages.

INT. MARCUS'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

The office is exactly as Marcus left it. The fire killed him at home, not here. His terminal is still active, still logged into government systems under a temporary admin account.

The figure sits at the desk. Plugs in a data stick. Starts copying files.

ON SCREEN: Progress bar. 37% complete.

The figure's face is obscured—we see only hands, silhouette. Professional. Efficient.

The terminal chimes softly. A notification window appears:

**"Remote access detected. Location: External network."**

The figure freezes.

Types rapidly. Pulls up network logs. Sees Sera's trace—she's accessing the same system from outside the building, watching in real-time.

The figure yanks the data stick out. Stands. Moves fast toward the door.

CUT TO:

INT. THE LIMINAL - COCKPIT - NIGHT (INTERCUT)

Sera is at the terminal, watching the access logs. Kael is pulling on a jacket, already moving toward the exit.

**SERA:** "They're still inside. Third floor, west wing."

**KAEL:** "Can you lock them in?"

**SERA:** "Not without admin credentials. But I can track them."

Kael is already gone.

CUT TO:

EXT. FEDERAL ACCOUNTS BUILDING - LOADING DOCK - NIGHT

The figure exits through a service door. Walks calmly to a parked vehicle. Not running—that would attract attention.

They get in. Drive away.

Kael arrives thirty seconds too late. Watches the taillights disappear into the city.

**KAEL (into comm):** "They're gone."

**SERA (over comm):** "I got a partial visual from the security feed before they cut it. Sending it now."

Kael's handheld displays a grainy image: a person in business attire, face obscured by a hat and scarf. No identifying features.

But one detail stands out: a corporate ID badge clipped to their jacket. The logo is visible.

**SERA (over comm):** "That's Asymptote."

**SMASH TO BLACK.**

**TITLE CARD: TETHER**

**EPISODE 2: "THE PATTERN"**

---

## 3. MAIN DRAMATIC QUESTION

**"How big is this?"**

Episode 1 established that Marcus was murdered for his investigation. Episode 2 expands the scope: this isn't just about Marcus. The conspiracy touches campaign finance, media manipulation, and the systematic destruction of moderate politics. By the end of this episode, Kael and Sera will understand the shape of the beast—even if they don't yet know how to fight it.

---

## 4. KEY SCENES

### SCENE A: The Morning After (Recalibration)

**LOCATION:** The Liminal, docked at landing field, early morning

**PURPOSE:** Ground the investigation. Show Kael and Sera processing what they've learned. Establish their dynamic.

Kael and Sera are sitting in the galley, drinking coffee that tastes like ship rations. Neither of them slept.

Sera is running searches on the Asymptote badge logo. Kael is reviewing Marcus's files again, cross-referencing transaction records.

**SERA:** "Asymptote Capital Group. Officially, they're a private equity firm. Tech investments, media holdings, real estate. Boring rich-people stuff."

**KAEL:** "Unofficially?"

**SERA:** "Marcus traced their money into seventeen different PACs. Progressive causes, conservative causes, libertarian think tanks. All of them."

She pulls up a network diagram. Lines connecting Asymptote to shell companies to campaign organizations.

**SERA:** "He called it 'attention arbitrage.' They're not funding candidates. They're funding conflict."

**KAEL:** "And someone from Asymptote just broke into a federal building to erase Marcus's work."

**SERA:** "Which means they know we're looking."

Kael nods slowly.

**KAEL:** "We need to understand what they're protecting. What's the actual mechanism? How does this work?"

**SERA:** "Marcus's files mention a name. Someone who used to work for Asymptote. A whistleblower, maybe."

She pulls up a note.

**ON SCREEN:** "Jordan Reeve—former Asymptote analyst. Last known: New Francisco. Tried to contact oversight. Nothing came of it."

**KAEL:** "Where is Reeve now?"

**SERA:** "No idea. But if Marcus found them once, we can too."

---

### SCENE B: The Whistleblower (Jordan Reeve)

**LOCATION:** A public park, New Francisco, late morning

**PURPOSE:** Introduce the whistleblower. Expand understanding of the conspiracy. Establish danger.

Kael and Sera track Jordan Reeve through public records and social feeds. They find them in a park, sitting on a bench, feeding pigeons.

Jordan Reeve (early 30s, tired, wary) sees them coming. Doesn't run. Just watches them approach.

**REEVE:** "Let me guess. You're friends of Marcus Oyelaran."

**KAEL:** "You knew him?"

**REEVE:** "He reached out six months ago. Asked me about Asymptote. I told him what I knew."

**SERA:** "Which was?"

Reeve looks around, checking to see if anyone's listening. No one is.

**REEVE:** "I was an analyst. My job was to model engagement metrics—figure out which cultural conflicts would generate the most attention. Abortion, immigration, gun control, gender issues. We ran simulations, predicted flashpoints, then invested accordingly."

**KAEL:** "Invested how?"

**REEVE:** "Media companies. Influencer networks. PACs. We'd fund both sides of an issue, then sit back and watch the engagement numbers climb. Every argument, every outraged post, every comment thread—that's ad revenue. Data capture. Behavioral profiling."

**SERA:** "You're saying Asymptote profits from keeping people angry."

**REEVE:** "Not just angry. Divided. The more polarized society gets, the more time people spend on platforms. And the platforms pay us for the content that keeps them there."

Kael absorbs this.

**KAEL:** "What about moderates? Candidates like Vanessa Locke?"

Reeve's expression darkens.

**REEVE:** "They're bad for business. Someone who brings people together, who reduces conflict—that's a threat to the model. So they get targeted. Oppo research. Coordinated media attacks. Funding for spoiler candidates. It's systematic."

**SERA:** "And legal?"

**REEVE:** "Technically. Everything we did was within campaign finance laws. Because we helped write the laws."

**KAEL:** "So why did you leave?"

Long pause.

**REEVE:** "Because I realized we weren't just profiting from division. We were creating it. And no one was going to stop us because half the regulators are funded by the same people."

**SERA:** "Will you testify? Go public?"

Reeve laughs bitterly.

**REEVE:** "I tried. Filed a complaint with oversight. Nothing happened. Then I got a visit from Asymptote's legal team. They explained—very politely—that I'd signed an NDA, and any further disclosures would result in financial ruin and criminal charges."

**KAEL:** "So you stopped."

**REEVE:** "I stopped."

Kael and Sera exchange a look.

**KAEL:** "Marcus didn't stop. And they killed him."

Reeve's face hardens.

**REEVE:** "Yeah. I heard about that."

**SERA:** "Help us finish what he started."

**REEVE:** "I can't. I have a kid. A life. I can't risk it."

**KAEL:** "Then at least tell us who's at the top. Who's running this?"

Reeve hesitates. Then pulls out a data stick.

**REEVE:** "I kept copies. Names, transaction records, internal memos. It's all encrypted. If anything happens to me, it gets released automatically."

They hand the stick to Sera.

**REEVE:** "But you need to understand—this isn't a few bad actors. This is how the system works now. You can't just arrest someone and fix it."

**KAEL:** "We're not trying to fix it. We're trying to make it visible."

Reeve studies him. Nods slowly.

**REEVE:** "Good luck."

They leave Reeve on the bench. Kael glances back once. Reeve is still feeding the pigeons, looking small and tired.

---

### SCENE C: The Data (Connecting the Dots)

**LOCATION:** Sera's apartment, New Francisco

**PURPOSE:** Decrypt Reeve's files. Reveal the scale of the conspiracy. Name names.

Sera's apartment is small, cluttered with old tech and data storage. She's been living here since Marcus died. It feels temporary.

She plugs in Reeve's data stick. Kael watches over her shoulder as she works through the encryption.

When the files open, they're staring at spreadsheets, org charts, and internal communications.

**ON SCREEN:**

- **The Investors:** Eight names. Ultra-wealthy individuals. Tech founders, hedge fund managers, media moguls.
- **Asymptote's Portfolio:** Stakes in news networks, social platforms, data brokers, and campaign infrastructure.
- **The Mechanism:** Funding both progressive and conservative causes through shell PACs, ensuring perpetual conflict.
- **The Targets:** A list of moderate candidates systematically destroyed over the past decade. Vanessa Locke is the most recent.

Sera scrolls through internal memos. One catches Kael's attention.

**MEMO (on screen):**
"Re: Locke Campaign—Target for Q3. Oppo research greenlit. Coordinate with media partners for rollout. Projected engagement lift: 12-18%."

Dated three months before Vanessa Locke's campaign collapsed.

**SERA:** "They planned it. Months in advance."

**KAEL:** "And made money on the destruction."

Sera keeps scrolling. Stops on a name.

**ON SCREEN:** "Elias Horne—Managing Director. Primary liaison with Investors."

**SERA:** "Horne isn't just involved. He's running point."

**KAEL:** "Where is he?"

Sera pulls up a public calendar. Elias Horne is scheduled to speak at a tech conference tomorrow. Public event. Open registration.

**SERA:** "New Francisco Convention Center. Panel on 'The Future of Democratic Engagement.'"

Kael almost laughs.

**KAEL:** "Of course he is."

---

### SCENE D: The Sister's Grief (Emotional Beat)

**LOCATION:** Sera's apartment, evening

**PURPOSE:** Deepen Sera's character. Show the cost of this investigation. Balance action with emotion.

Sera is standing at the window, looking out at the city. Kael is on the couch, reviewing files on his handheld.

Long silence.

**SERA:** "Marcus used to say the system wasn't broken. It was working exactly as designed. I thought he was being cynical."

**KAEL:** "He wasn't."

**SERA:** "He tried to do the right thing. Follow the rules. Report what he found. And they killed him for it."

She turns to face Kael.

**SERA:** "What's the point? Even if we expose Asymptote, even if we name The Investors—they'll just adapt. Rebrand. Keep going."

**KAEL:** "Maybe."

**SERA:** "So why are we doing this?"

Kael looks at her.

**KAEL:** "Because Marcus thought it mattered. And because if no one tries, they've already won."

Sera holds his gaze. Then nods.

**SERA:** "Alright."

She sits next to him.

**SERA:** "Tomorrow, we confront Horne. Make him know we're coming."

**KAEL:** "And then?"

**SERA:** "Then we see who comes for us."

---

### SCENE E: The Convention (Public Confrontation)

**LOCATION:** New Francisco Convention Center, next day

**PURPOSE:** Kael confronts Elias Horne. Escalate the stakes. Establish the antagonists.

The convention center is packed. Tech executives, investors, media personalities. The elite of the attention economy, congratulating themselves on innovation and progress.

Kael and Sera move through the crowd. They're underdressed, out of place. No one pays attention to them.

On stage, a panel is underway. The moderator introduces the next speaker: **ELIAS HORNE**.

Horne (50s, polished, charismatic) takes the stage. Smiling. Confident.

**HORNE:** "We live in an age of unprecedented connection. More people have more access to information than ever before. That's not a problem—it's an opportunity. Our job as innovators is to ensure that engagement remains free, dynamic, and profitable."

Applause.

Kael watches from the back of the room. His jaw is tight.

The panel ends. Horne steps off the stage, shaking hands, accepting congratulations.

Kael moves toward him. Sera follows.

**KAEL:** "Mr. Horne."

Horne turns. Smiles reflexively. Doesn't recognize them.

**HORNE:** "Yes?"

**KAEL:** "I wanted to ask you about Asymptote Media Partners. Specifically, your investments in political campaigns."

The smile doesn't falter, but something flickers in Horne's eyes.

**HORNE:** "I'm sorry, do I know you?"

**KAEL:** "No. But you knew Marcus Oyelaran."

Now the smile disappears.

Horne glances around. Checks to see who's listening. Then leans in slightly.

**HORNE:** "I'm not sure what you think you know, Mr...?"

**KAEL:** "Vasaro."

**HORNE:** "Mr. Vasaro. But I'd advise caution. Making unfounded accusations can have consequences."

**SERA:** "Like apartment fires?"

Horne's eyes flick to Sera. Recognition dawns.

**HORNE:** "Ah. The sister. I'm very sorry for your loss. Tragic accident."

**SERA:** "It wasn't an accident."

Horne's expression hardens.

**HORNE:** "If you'll excuse me—"

He turns to leave. Kael steps into his path.

**KAEL:** "We have Marcus's files. And Jordan Reeve's. We know what you're doing."

Horne stops. Turns back. The polished facade cracks for just a moment.

**HORNE:** "You have no idea what you're interfering with."

**KAEL:** "Then explain it to me."

Horne studies him. Then smiles—cold, calculated.

**HORNE:** "Let's say, hypothetically, there were people who understood that conflict is inevitable. That human beings are tribal, ideological, and easily manipulated. Wouldn't it be better if that conflict were... managed? Optimized? Profited from, yes, but also contained?"

**KAEL:** "You're not containing it. You're amplifying it."

**HORNE:** "We're giving people what they want. They choose to engage. They choose to argue. They choose to hate each other. We just make it more efficient."

**SERA:** "And you make billions doing it."

**HORNE:** "Yes. We do."

He steps closer. Drops his voice.

**HORNE:** "Here's what you need to understand. The system you're trying to fight? It's bigger than Asymptote. It's bigger than me. It's how the world works now. And you can't stop it."

**KAEL:** "Maybe not. But we can name it."

Horne's smile returns.

**HORNE:** "Go ahead. Try. No one will care. They're too busy fighting each other."

He walks away.

Kael and Sera stand in the crowd, watching him go.

**SERA:** "He's right, isn't he? We can't stop this."

**KAEL:** "No. But we can make sure people know it's happening."

### SCENE F: The Surveillance (They're Being Watched)

**LOCATION:** Street outside convention center, then Sera's apartment

**PURPOSE:** Establish danger. Show that Asymptote is responding. End on a cliffhanger.

Kael and Sera leave the convention center. Walk through the city streets back toward Sera's apartment.

Kael notices something. Stops. Looks back.

A vehicle has been following them. Three blocks now. Same distance. Same speed.

**KAEL:** "We're being followed."

**SERA:** "Asymptote?"

**KAEL:** "Probably."

They keep walking. The vehicle stays with them.

CUT TO:

INT. SERA'S APARTMENT - EVENING

They're back at Sera's place. Kael checks the windows. The vehicle is parked across the street.

**SERA:** "They're not even hiding it."

**KAEL:** "They don't need to. They're sending a message."

Sera's comm device buzzes. She picks it up. Frowns.

**SERA:** "It's from an anonymous account."

She opens the message. Her face goes pale.

**ON SCREEN:** A photo. Jordan Reeve's apartment. Police tape across the door. A news headline: "Apparent Suicide."

Below the photo, a text message:

**"Stop asking questions."**

Sera looks at Kael.

**SERA:** "They killed Reeve."

**KAEL:** "Or they want us to think they did."

**SERA:** "What's the difference?"

Kael doesn't answer.

Sera's hands are shaking. She sits down hard.

**SERA:** "This is real. They're going to kill us."

**KAEL:** "Maybe."

**SERA:** "Then what do we do?"

Kael looks out the window at the surveillance vehicle. Then back at Sera.

**KAEL:** "We make enough noise that killing us becomes more expensive than ignoring us."

**SERA:** "How?"

**KAEL:** "We go public. Release everything. Marcus's files, Reeve's data, the pattern. All of it."

**SERA:** "And hope someone listens?"

**KAEL:** "No. Hope that enough people listen that we become harder to silence."

Sera considers this. Then nods.

**SERA:** "Alright. Let's do it."

Kael's comm device buzzes. He checks it. His expression changes.

**KAEL:** "There's a problem."

**SERA:** "What?"

**KAEL:** "Someone just tried to access The Liminal's systems remotely. They're trying to lock me out of my own ship."

**SERA:** "Can they do that?"

**KAEL:** "If they get through the firewalls, yeah."

He grabs his jacket.

**KAEL:** "I need to get back to the ship. Now."

**SERA:** "I'm coming with you."

They move toward the door.

Before they reach it, the lights go out.

The entire building goes dark.

Sera freezes. Kael pulls out a flashlight.

**KAEL:** "That's not a power outage."

From outside, the sound of footsteps. Multiple people. Moving fast.

Kael and Sera exchange a look.

**SERA:** "Back exit?"

**KAEL:** "Now."

They run.

**SMASH TO BLACK.**

**END EPISODE 2.**

## 5. NEW CHARACTERS INTRODUCED

### JORDAN REEVE (The Whistleblower)

**AGE:** Early 30s

**OCCUPATION:** Former Asymptote analyst, now unemployed/independent contractor

**PERSONALITY:**
- Worn down, wary, intelligent
- Regrets what they participated in but too scared to act
- Wanted to do the right thing, got crushed by the system
- Has a child—personal stakes prevent heroism
- Provides crucial intel but won't go public

**ARC:** Appears in Episode 2, provides data to Kael and Sera. Dies (or appears to die) off-screen by episode's end. A cautionary tale of what happens to whistleblowers.

---

### ELIAS HORNE (The Face of Asymptote)

**AGE:** 50s

**OCCUPATION:** Managing Director, Asymptote Media Partners / Asymptote Capital Group

**PERSONALITY:**
- Polished, charismatic, ruthless
- Genuinely believes he's optimizing an inevitable system
- Not cartoonishly evil—sees himself as pragmatic
- Articulate about the philosophy behind the conspiracy
- Willing to threaten, but prefers legal and financial warfare over violence

**ARC:** Introduced as a name in Episode 1. Becomes a face in Episode 2. Will recur throughout the series as one of The Investors' representatives. Not the ultimate villain, but a tangible antagonist.

---

## 6. INVESTIGATION PROGRESS (What Kael Learns)

### What Kael Knows by End of Episode 2:

1. **The conspiracy has a name and a mechanism:** Asymptote Media Partners funds both political extremes to maximize engagement and profit from division.

2. **The Investors:** Eight ultra-wealthy individuals who coordinate through private channels. Elias Horne is their public-facing operative.

3. **The targeting is systematic:** Moderate candidates like Vanessa Locke are destroyed deliberately, months in advance, with coordinated media attacks and spoiler funding.

4. **It's technically legal:** Everything Asymptote does is within campaign finance laws—laws they helped write through lobbying.

5. **Whistleblowers die or disappear:** Jordan Reeve provided data, then "committed suicide" (or was made to look like they did).

6. **Kael and Sera are being actively hunted:** Surveillance, cyberattacks on The Liminal, and physical intimidation.

### What Kael Doesn't Know Yet:

- How deep The Investors' influence goes (media, platforms, government)
- Whether there's any institutional power willing to act
- What Marcus's final days looked like (more to uncover from Sera's memories)
- Whether going public will accomplish anything or just get them killed faster

---

## 7. EMOTIONAL THROUGHLINE (How Kael Changes)

### START OF EPISODE:
Kael is still operating on grim obligation. He's chosen to stay and investigate, but he's not hopeful. He's methodical, detached, doing the next logical thing.

### MIDDLE OF EPISODE:
Meeting Jordan Reeve—a whistleblower who tried and failed—reinforces Kael's worldview. The system crushes people who resist. But it also clarifies his purpose: if he's going to do this, he can't half-commit. He has to make enough noise that silence becomes impossible.

Confronting Elias Horne is the first time Kael lets himself feel anger. Horne's smug justification—"we're just giving people what they want"—cuts through Kael's detachment. It's one thing to see the system as broken. It's another to meet the people who broke it and hear them explain why it's good business.

### END OF EPISODE:
Kael is running. Literally. The system has noticed him. He and Sera are targets now. But instead of retreating, Kael's instinct is to escalate: go public, release everything, make enough noise that killing them becomes expensive.

It's not hope. It's strategy. But underneath the strategy, something is shifting. He's not just doing this for Marcus anymore. He's doing it because Horne's smile made him want to break something.

### THE SHIFT:
From "Someone has to do this" to "I'm going to make sure they know I did it."

Still not a hero. Still not optimistic. But no longer passive.

## 8. CLIFFHANGER/HOOK (Why We Watch Episode 3)

**FINAL MOMENT:**

Kael and Sera are running through the darkened building. The sound of footsteps behind them. They reach the back stairwell, burst through the door.

Two figures in tactical gear are waiting.

Kael doesn't hesitate. He tackles one, drives them into the wall. Sera goes for the other, but she's not trained for this—she's a data analyst, not a fighter.

The second figure grabs her.

Kael spins, sees Sera struggling. The first figure recovers, moves toward Kael.

Then—

A voice from the darkness.

**VOICE:** "That's enough."

The figures stop. Step back.

A man steps into the dim light of the emergency exit. Older, weathered, calm. Not Asymptote. Someone else.

**MAN:** "Kael Vasaro. We need to talk."

**KAEL:** "Who the hell are you?"

**MAN:** "Someone who knew Marcus. And someone who thinks you might actually have a chance."

The man gestures to the tactical figures.

**MAN:** "These two work for me. They're here to make sure you don't do anything stupid. Like get yourselves killed before you finish what Marcus started."

Kael and Sera don't move. Don't trust him.

**MAN:** "My name is Victor Lang. And if you want to take down Asymptote, you're going to need help."

**SMASH TO BLACK.**

**TO BE CONTINUED.**

# PRODUCTION NOTES

## Tone Continuity

Both episodes maintain the "exhausted clarity" tone. Kael doesn't become heroic or hopeful—he becomes committed. The investigations feel grounded: public records, data analysis, following money trails. No high-tech sci-fi shortcuts.

The dialogue avoids preachiness. Kael observes more than he lectures. When he does speak, it's flat, matter-of-fact. "Yeah, that's how it works. You're just noticing?"

---

## Pacing

- **Episode 1:** Slower build. Atmosphere, character, stakes. Ends with the mystery opening.
- **Episode 2:** Faster. Action, confrontation, escalation. Ends with immediate danger and a new player.

---

## Visual Motifs

- **Screens and feeds:** Constant background presence of news, ads, algorithmic curation.
- **Empty spaces vs. crowds:** Kael in solitude on The Liminal vs. the chaotic density of Earth.
- **Data visualization:** Transaction networks, maps, connection diagrams. The pattern becoming visible.

---

## Music

- **Episode 1:** Sparse, tense, industrial. The loneliness of space vs. the noise of Earth.
- **Episode 2:** Building tension. Rhythmic, percussive. The investigation accelerating.

---

## Next Episode Preview

**Episode 3: "The Fixer"**

Victor Lang is revealed as a former intelligence operative who's been tracking The Investors for years. He introduces Kael and Sera to the "resistance"—a loose network of journalists, activists, and ex-government officials who've been trying (and failing) to expose the conspiracy.

But Lang has resources Marcus didn't: secure channels, safe houses, and a plan to leak the data without getting killed.

The question: Can Kael trust him? Or is Lang just another player in the same game?
