# TETHER: Narrative Architecture Plan
## Building a Production-Quality Story

---

## THE CHALLENGE

We have:
- A conspiracy (Attention Arbitrage — investors funding both sides)
- An inciting incident (Kael sees Marcus is dead, burns for Earth)
- A tone (exhausted clarity)
- A theme ("Connected but not loving" / "Someone has to")

We need:
- A full narrative with multiple arcs
- Characters who come and go
- Foreshadowing and payoffs
- Mystery that unfolds in layers
- Emotional beats that land
- A structure worthy of prestige TV or film

---

## PROPOSED STRUCTURE: LIMITED SERIES (8 Episodes)

Why 8 episodes:
- Enough room for complexity without padding
- Natural two-act structure (4+4) with midpoint shift
- Each episode can have its own shape while serving the whole
- Maps well to game chapters if needed

### Episode Breakdown (High Level)

| Ep | Title Concept | Primary Focus |
|----|---------------|---------------|
| 1 | **The Return** | Inciting incident → Arrival on Earth |
| 2 | **The Sister** | Meeting Marcus's twin, first breadcrumbs |
| 3 | **The Trail** | Following Marcus's investigation, meet the Fixer |
| 4 | **The Pattern** | Scope expands — this is bigger than one death |
| 5 | **The Believer** | Meet the resistance, Kael's worldview challenged |
| 6 | **The Trap** | Someone isn't what they seem, Kael compromised |
| 7 | **The Choice** | All is lost → Decision to stay and fight |
| 8 | **The Cost** | Final confrontation, resolution, what remains |

## CHARACTER ARCHITECTURE

### TIER 1: Present Throughout
- **Kael Vasaro** — Protagonist, POV character
- **Marcus Oyelaran** — Dead, but present through artifacts, memories, recordings
- **[Sister Name TBD]** — Marcus's twin, Kael's anchor to Earth

### TIER 2: Arc Characters (Come and Go)
- **The Fixer** — Appears Ep 3-4, 7-8. Knows the underworld.
- **The Whistleblower** — Appears Ep 4-6. Corporate insider. Dies or disappears.
- **The True Believer** — Appears Ep 5-7. Represents hope Kael doesn't have.
- **The Old Spacer** — Appears Ep 2, 7. Mirror for Kael. What he could become.

### TIER 3: Antagonist Presence
- **The System** — The conspiracy itself, faceless
- **The Face** — A specific representative Kael eventually confronts
- **The Hunters** — People who notice Kael asking questions

---

## MYSTERY LAYERS (Revelation Timing)

### What Kael Thinks He Knows (Ep 1-2)
- Marcus died in a fire
- Something was wrong
- He needs to find out what

### First Layer Revealed (Ep 3-4)
- Marcus was investigating money trails
- The fire wasn't an accident
- Someone wanted him silenced

### Second Layer Revealed (Ep 4-5)
- The money goes to BOTH political sides
- This isn't corruption — it's a system
- Vanessa Locke's destruction connects

### Third Layer Revealed (Ep 6-7)
- The Investors — who they are
- Asymptote — how it works
- The scale — this is how the world runs now

### Final Understanding (Ep 8)
- What victory actually means (and doesn't mean)
- What can be saved
- What Kael chooses to do with that knowledge

---

## SUBPLOT ARCHITECTURE

### A-Plot: The Investigation
Kael following Marcus's trail, uncovering the conspiracy layer by layer.

### B-Plot: The Sister
Kael's relationship with Marcus's twin — learning who Marcus became, processing grief through someone who shares it, possibly protecting her as danger escalates.

### C-Plot: The Resistance
The True Believer and their movement — represents an alternative response to the broken world. Challenges Kael's detachment. May succeed or fail independent of Kael's arc.

### D-Plot: Earth Itself
Kael's reacclimatization to a world he left. Sensory, emotional, philosophical. The contrast with space. What's changed, what hasn't.

---

## FORESHADOWING FRAMEWORK

### Setup in Ep 1-2, Payoff in Ep 7-8
- A detail about The Liminal that becomes crucial
- Something Marcus said years ago that gains new meaning
- A choice Kael makes early that echoes in the finale

### Setup in Ep 3-4, Payoff in Ep 5-6
- A character who seems helpful but isn't
- A piece of evidence that's misinterpreted
- The sister knows something she doesn't realize she knows

### Running Threads
- The Vanessa Locke story (background in Ep 1, resurfaces Ep 4-5, connects Ep 7)
- Kael's relationship with solitude (tested throughout)
- "Someone has to" — phrase that evolves in meaning

---

## DEVELOPMENT SEQUENCE

### Phase A: Episode Spines
For each episode, develop:
- Cold open concept
- Main dramatic question
- Key scenes (3-5 per episode)
- Character entrances/exits
- Cliffhanger or resolution
- Emotional throughline

### Phase B: Character Deep Dives
For each major character:
- Full biography
- Voice and speech patterns
- Arc across the series
- Key scenes they carry
- Relationship dynamics

### Phase C: Scene-by-Scene
For each episode:
- Full scene breakdown
- Dialogue samples for key moments
- Action/investigation beats
- Emotional beats

### Phase D: Pilot Script
Write Episode 1 as proof of concept:
- Full dialogue
- Scene descriptions
- Tone established
- Hook delivered

---

## EP DECISIONS (Locked)

### Format: 8-Episode Limited Series
- Room for complexity
- Natural midpoint structure (4+4)
- Maps to game chapters
- Reference: True Detective S1, Andor

### The Sister's Role
- **Love interest** — physical relationship with Kael
- But the intimacy underscores the theme: physical connection isn't enough, and that's what's been lost
- **Key supporting early** — central in Ep 2-3
- **Voice-over-comms later** — stays in touch but not physically present
- **One more in-person meeting** — later in the series
- **Friends throughout** — relationship doesn't sour

### Antagonist Structure
- **Systemic but with faces**
- Multiple ultra-wealthy figures (The Investors)
- Each has a different personality/flavor
- Confronting them doesn't "win" — they represent the system but don't control it
- The system persists regardless of individual actors

---

## NEXT STEPS

Once structure is approved:
1. Develop Episode 1 spine in detail (cold open → cliffhanger)
2. Name and develop Marcus's sister
3. Map the investigation breadcrumbs across episodes
4. Identify supporting cast and their arcs
