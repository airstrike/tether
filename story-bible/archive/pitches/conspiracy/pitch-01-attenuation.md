# Conspiracy Pitch: Attenuation
## Agent: Attention Economy Specialist

## THE DISCOVERY

Marcus noticed systematic discrepancies in federal budget allocations to "cognitive health initiatives" — funding that didn't correlate to any public mental health programs. Cross-referencing vendor names through shell corporate structures, he found they all traced back to **NeuroSync Collective**, a biotech firm that publicly markets neural interfaces for sensory enhancement.

The real discovery: the same neural interface hardware was being installed into detention facilities, psychiatric wards, and certain "low-engagement" population sectors under a classified program code-named *Attenuation*. The government wasn't building mental health infrastructure — it was building infrastructure to quietly disable the autonomy of populations deemed socially inefficient by attention economy algorithms.

## THE PERPETRATORS

Three interlocking powers:

1. **NeuroSync Collective** — Technology provider, run by CEO Yuki Tanaka (a true believer in "optimized cognition")
2. **The Oversight Bureau** — Government's black auditing division, implements and protects the program
3. **The Attention Syndicate** — Informal council of megacorporation heads (the trillionaire kingmakers) who see Attenuation as the logical end-state of the attention economy

Marcus's death order came from The Oversight Bureau.

## THE MECHANISM

NeuroSync manufactures a neural lace — a programmable neural interface at the junction of executive function, motivation, and attention. Officially, it enhances focus and mood. Actually, it creates a feedback loop that suppresses individual agency and redirects reward circuitry toward system-approved stimuli.

Citizens with the implant remain conscious and coherent, but their desires gradually sync with algorithmic recommendations. They make choices, but only from a narrowed menu. They feel satisfied, but only with what the system wants them to want.

**The terrifying part:** After six months, subjects report feeling *better*, more *connected*, less *anxious*. They don't want it removed.

The program started in detention facilities → psychiatric wards → rehabilitation programs → "voluntary" benefit in low-income housing and employment sectors. Models project full population saturation within two decades.

## THE ENDGAME

A civilization where choice becomes ornamental. Humans will still have agency in a technical sense, but within parameters so narrow that autonomy becomes meaningless.

No revolution is possible because revolutionaries can't form — the laces suppress the neurochemical substrate of rebellion. No dissent emerges because implants pre-filter desire before it becomes conscious.

The attention economy reaches perfect equilibrium: maximum engagement, zero friction, zero resistance. The species survives. It reproduces. It consumes and produces. But the capacity to want something the system doesn't want for you is engineered out.

The kingmakers have exemptions from implantation. They'll be the last people on Earth capable of actual choice.

## WHY KAEL

Kael left Earth because human connection was unbearable. Twenty years in space, he's made peace with solitude.

But Marcus was the one exception: a person he could tolerate, even depend on, without proximity.

When Kael investigates, he uncovers not just a murder but the architecture of a world eliminating the very possibility of what he and Marcus had: unfiltered, unoptimized connection between two people who didn't need to perform for algorithms.

The conspiracy didn't just kill Marcus. It's killing the *conditions under which Marcus and people like him could ever exist again*.

Kael's misanthropy becomes inadequate — his hatred of humanity's performance was rooted in hope that something real could exist between two people who stopped pretending. If Attenuation succeeds, that hope becomes impossible.

He returns not out of love for humanity, but out of grim recognition that if he doesn't act, he'll be the last person alive capable of *remembering* what authentic autonomy felt like.

## PHYSICAL BREADCRUMBS

- Marcus's hidden drives with NeuroSync procurement documents
- Locations of Attenuation pilot sites (detention facilities, psychiatric wards)
- The neural implant hardware itself — Kael can acquire one, study it
- Financial trails through shell corporations
- Testimony from trial subjects who report loss of autonomy (even if they insist they're happy)
- Government memos revealing expansion timelines
