# Inciting Incident Pitch: The Vanessa Locke Implosion
## Agent: Moderate Candidate Approach

---

## THE MODERATE CANDIDATE

**Vanessa Locke** — Former Comptroller of New England Sector, running as an independent for the North American Continental Senate.

Her platform: algorithmic transparency regulation. Not a ban, not deregulation, just *disclosure* — let people see what's being amplified and why.

Boring. Technical. Moderate. Exactly the kind of candidate the system can't tolerate.

## THE SCANDAL

Anonymous leaks reveal her campaign received $2.3 million from **Helix Strategic Partners** — a phantom entity with no history, no website, barely a registration.

Within twelve hours, the donation is flagged. Within six hours of that, both sides attack:

- **Progressives:** "Crypto-libertarian fraud backed by dark money think tanks"
- **Conservatives:** "Woke technocrat plant funded by Soros-style NGOs"

Same footage. Same timing. Opposite narratives.

She suspends her campaign two days later.

## THE INCONSISTENCY KAEL NOTICES

The *speed*.

Elections monitoring is chronically underfunded — it takes weeks to flag questionable donations. This one went public in half a day, complete with coordinated talking points for both left and right media.

Someone didn't just leak this. They *packaged* it for maximum damage from both directions simultaneously.

That's not organic. That's engineered.

## THE CONNECTION TO MARCUS

Buried on the same news feed, six stories down: a federal auditor found dead in New Francisco. Suicide.

The office code in the reference number: **FAD — Federal Accounts Division.**

Marcus's division.

Kael remembers the last message Marcus sent him three years ago: *"If you ever see my name in the news, assume I was asking the wrong questions."*

Marcus tracked money. Vanessa Locke was destroyed by phantom money. The timing is too close. The pattern is too clear.

Marcus saw what Kael is seeing now — and it got him killed.

## THE SCENE

Kael isn't watching the news feed in the Kepler Station cantina, but his brain does what it always does — pattern matching, looking for inconsistencies. Vanessa Locke's face appears: campaign collapse, funding scandal. Both the progressive and conservative feeds are running identical attacks with inverted villains. Too symmetrical. Too fast.

He pulls up the details. Locke was running on algorithmic transparency — boring, moderate, dangerous only to people who profit from opacity. The donor that destroyed her barely exists: Helix Strategic Partners, a shell with one transaction and no history. Elections monitoring is slow, but this was flagged in twelve hours and weaponized in six. Someone wanted this found. Someone wanted her gone.

He scrolls further. Buried six stories down: federal auditor dead, suicide, **FAD-2147-003**. Federal Accounts Division. Marcus's office. Kael sits very still. He pulls up an archive he hasn't touched in five years and finds the last message Marcus sent: *"If you ever see my name in the news, assume I was asking the wrong questions."*

He looks back at the feed. Vanessa Locke's face. The phantom donor. The synchronized attacks. The auditor. Kael doesn't believe in coincidences. He believes in patterns. And this one leads back to the only person who ever understood why he left.
