# Inciting Incident Pitch: The News Stumble
## Agent: News Approach

## THE SCENE

Kael is docked at Kepler Station — a long refueling stop he makes every few months. Routine. He buys supplies, speaks to no one, leaves.

This time, the station's information kiosk is down, and while waiting for service, he wanders into the common area — a gap in his usually rigid isolation.

An old news feed plays on a wall monitor: grainy, background noise, the kind of thing that blurs into station ambience. He's not watching.

But then the word "suicide" catches in his ear, paired with a name: *"Federal Accounts Division auditor Marcus Oyelaran found dead in his apartment in New Francisco. Official ruling: suicide by system overload."*

The report is sparse, almost bureaucratic in its indifference. But there's something off — the anchor's hesitation, a single phrase: "no note was found, but preliminary investigation ruled out foul play."

Kael stops. That's not how you talk about a suicide. That's how you talk about something you're covering.

## THE INVESTIGATION

He requests the full article on the kiosk — searching his own fragmented memory, checking the timestamp (three weeks old, already buried).

Marcus. The *one* name attached to the *one* conversation that mattered. They haven't spoken in... what, five years? Longer? The communication just stopped, as these things do.

But Kael recognizes the sensation — the small jolt of *oh, I forgot about you until I didn't.*

He reads the bare details again: Marcus's apartment, a secured building, no signs of forced entry, the official coroner's determination.

And then he does something he hasn't done in a decade: he contacts a fixer he knows in the station, asks a favor, pulls enough threads to get a copy of the actual report.

What he finds is worse than death. It's erasure. Records too clean. A timeline that doesn't scan. A man's life filed away in two paragraphs.

## THE DECISION

Kael — who has spent twenty years perfecting the art of not caring — feels something move inside him. Not emotion exactly. Obligation. The sick recognition that the only person in the world who understood what he was doing by leaving is now dead, and no one is asking the right questions.

He looks out at the void from the station's viewport, at The Liminal waiting in the dock, at the life he'd arranged so carefully to avoid this exact moment.

Then he logs a course change. Earth. He's going back.

Not to grieve. Not to heal. Just to know.

## WHY THIS WORKS

- **Organic encounter:** Kael doesn't actively consume news. He stumbles into it passively.
- **Sensory trigger:** The anchor's hesitation and that single wrong-sounding phrase is what hooks him — his mind catches the *lie* before his conscience catches the loss.
- **Fits his character:** He doesn't let people in, but he *does* let Marcus in. The discovery that Marcus is dead *and* being erased breaks through his isolation.
- **Not about saving:** It's about witnessing. Making sure the person who mattered isn't forgotten while he watches.
