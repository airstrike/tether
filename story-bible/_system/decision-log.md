## DECISIONS

---

### Decision #1: The Conspiracy
**Date:** 2026-01-17
**Decision Point:** What did Marcus discover?

**Options Considered:**
- Round 1 (rejected as too sci-fi): Attenuation, Autonomy Erosion, Memory Archive, Prediction Machine
- Round 2: Attention Arbitrage, Authenticity Index, Emptiness Merchants

**Decision:** Attention Arbitrage (refined)

**Key Refinements:**
- Government is incompetent, not a cabal — captured through lobbying
- Ultra-wealthy investors are the real power, not a formal organization
- They fund both extremes, snuff out moderates/independents
- Goal is deregulation of tech/algorithms, political power is byproduct
- No villain to punch — just systems and incentives

**Reasoning:** Most grounded approach. Maps to current reality. Allows for thriller-shaped investigation while maintaining "everyone's complicit" theme.

**Implications:**
- Marcus died through legal harassment and system pressure, not assassination
- The Investors are a network, not an organization
- Kael's investigation follows money trails, not sci-fi breadcrumbs
- Victory can't be "defeat the bad guys" — the system is too distributed

### Decision #2: The Inciting Incident
**Date:** 2026-01-17
**Decision Point:** What makes Kael look up Marcus after 20 years?

**Options Considered:**
- Round 1 (rejected): Automated data dump, news stumble, mutual contact, echo protocol
- Round 2: Vanessa Locke implosion, Algorithm Audit bill

**Decision:** Vanessa Locke as backdrop + buried news item about Marcus

**Key Elements:**
- Kael sees Locke story, is tired of the same bullshit, almost mad at himself for clicking
- Doesn't investigate — just backdrop showing world is still broken
- Separately: "Federal auditor dies in fire. Twin sister survived."
- Kael connects: not many auditors with twin sisters in New Francisco
- Immediate 180, set course for Earth, opening credits

**New Story Elements:**
- Marcus has a **twin sister** (survivor, future character)
- Death was a **fire**, not suicide (more ambiguous, investigable)
- Vanessa Locke story connects to conspiracy, will resurface later

**Reasoning:** Respects audience intelligence. Kael figures it out himself. The hook is indirect, buried in the feed. The political story is backdrop, not investigation.
