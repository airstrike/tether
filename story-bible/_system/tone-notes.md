# TETHER Tone Notes
## Voice & Style Reference

---

## THE VOICE

**Not this:** Mr. Robot bleakness. Preachy anti-capitalism. Edgelord nihilism. Righteous anger.

**This:** The exhausted clarity of someone who saw through it all, left, and isn't surprised it got worse.

## KAEL'S VOICE CHARACTERISTICS

1. **Detached but not dead inside** — there's still a person in there, he just doesn't show it

2. **Sees through it, doesn't preach about it** — not trying to convince anyone of anything

3. **Residual cool** — opted out, but not a loser; there's competence and self-possession

4. **Dark observations stated flat** — "Yeah, that's how it works. You're just noticing?"

5. **The weariness of being right** — he saw this coming, left, and it got worse anyway

6. **Not righteous** — he's not better than anyone, he just stopped playing

## THE EXASPERATION

"Everyone's fucking brainwashed, man."

This is the energy. Not a rant. Not a manifesto. Just... the tired truth of someone who's watched it all happen. The tone captures:

- Exhaustion more than anger
- Observation more than accusation
- Dark humor as the only sane response
- The chaos of a world where everyone's hustling everyone else
- No clear villains, just systems that reward the worst in people

---

## WHAT THIS ISN'T

- **Not edgy:** He's past the age of thinking cynicism is cool
- **Not preachy:** He's not trying to wake anyone up
- **Not victimized:** He made his choice and it worked for him
- **Not hopeless:** He's still alive, still functioning, still capable
- **Not angry:** Anger requires caring. He just... observes.

## THE CRACK

The whole point of the story is that something gets through. The detachment has a limit. But the tone should make that crack *earn* itself — it should feel like a genuine surprise when Kael starts to give a shit about something.
