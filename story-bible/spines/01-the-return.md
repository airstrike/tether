# EPISODE 1: "The Return"
## Revised Spine — Action-Oriented Pilot

---

## SCENE 1: THE LIMINAL (Establishing)

**Kael wakes up.**

Bleary eyes. The familiar hum of The Liminal's systems. He's in his bunk — small, efficient, worn from twenty years of use. The ship around him is cramped but personal. Modifications everywhere. Tools mounted on walls. A coffee maker that's been repaired a dozen times.

He just docked after a long haul. Needs supplies. Needs to stretch his legs.

He gets up slowly. The routine of a man who's done this a thousand times.

---

## SCENE 2: DOCK LIFE (World-Building)

**Kepler Station. Outer belt. The margins.**

Kael walks the dock. This is his world — not Earth, not the inner planets. The spaces in between.

**The dock is alive:**
- Cargo bots rolling past, automated and efficient
- Ships in various states of repair
- The smell of fuel and recycled air
- Food stalls with synthetic protein shaped into familiar forms

**The mechanics — TOMAS and YUKI** — a married couple who run a repair bay near Kael's usual berth. He's known them for years. Not friends exactly, but familiar.

**Tomas:** "Vasaro. You look like shit."

**Kael:** "Long haul."

**Yuki:** "The Liminal holding up?"

**Kael:** "Always does."

**Tomas:** "We got a coupling that'd fit your starboard thruster. Fell off a transport. Legally."

**Kael:** "How much?"

**Tomas:** "For you? Cost plus ten."

**Kael:** "I'll think about it."

**Yuki:** "You always think about it. Then you buy it."

Kael almost smiles. Almost.

He grabs street food — something fried, unidentifiable protein, tastes fine. Eats it walking. Watches the station life flow around him.

**Bots everywhere.** Cleaning bots. Cargo bots. Security bots that scan faces without stopping. People ignore them. Part of the furniture.

This is the margin. Rougher than Earth, but honest. Transactions are clear. Nobody performs for algorithms out here. They're too busy surviving.

Kael finishes his food. Heads back to The Liminal.

---

## SCENE 3: SHIP LIFE / THE TURN

**Back on The Liminal.**

Kael checks his job board. Messages from brokers, shipping requests, salvage opportunities.

One catches his eye — decent pay, route to a belt colony. He accepts it.

While the nav computer plots the course, he's got time to kill. He pulls up a news feed. Not something he does often. But he's bored, waiting for the calculations.

**The feed cycles:**

Political noise. Vanessa Locke — some moderate candidate — destroyed by scandals from both sides. Progressives hate her. Conservatives hate her. The machine churning.

Kael clicks on it. Almost mad at himself. Did he really think something would be different? Twenty years gone and Earth is still the same bullshit.

He closes it. Scrolls.

**Then — buried six stories down:**

"Federal auditor dies in apartment fire. Twin sister survived."

Kael stops.

There aren't many federal auditors in New Francisco. There's only one he knows with a twin sister.

He pulls up the article. No name in the headline. But the details: Federal Accounts Division. New Francisco district. Apartment fire, cause under investigation.

**Marcus.**

Kael stares at the screen.

The nav computer pings. Course plotted. Ready to depart.

He cancels it.

New destination. Earth.

**TITLE CARD: TETHER**

The Liminal detaches from Kepler Station. Engines burn hot. The station shrinks behind him.

Music amps up.

He's going back.

---

## ACT ONE: ARRIVAL (Earth)

### Scene 4: Atmospheric Entry

Kael hasn't been to Earth in 20 years. The descent is sensory assault:
- The noise of the feeds, the notifications, the constant chatter
- The density — people everywhere, too close, bumping into each other while staring at screens
- The smell — synthetic, processed, nothing organic
- The light — artificial even when it's daylight

He's alien here now. His body language is wrong. He moves like someone who's used to being alone.

He puts on noise-cancelling **headphones**, plays **brown noise** — the familiar hum of The Liminal's systems. A portable cocoon. Safety. He takes them off when things look shady. Puts them back on when he thinks he's clear — which is why he doesn't hear Elara coming later.

### Scene 5: The Address

Kael has Marcus's old address from years ago. Hopes he never moved.

Gets there — lower-middle district of New Francisco. Dense housing blocks. The kind of place where people live because they can't afford to live anywhere else.

The building is there. Marcus's floor.

The apartment is **wrecked from the fire.** Scorch marks on the walls. Door frame warped. Caution tape that's been cut.

Someone's already been here.

---

## ACT TWO: THE CONFRONTATION

### Scene 6: Cleanup Crew

Kael enters carefully. The apartment is burned out — but someone's been through what's left. Professionally.

Two figures in tactical gear. Not cops. Paramilitary contractors. They're sifting through the wreckage, bagging anything that survived the fire.

Kael freezes. One of them turns.

**Shots fired.**

Kael dives. Returns fire (spacer's habit — always armed). The burned-out apartment becomes a firefight.

### Scene 7: The Key

In the chaos, Kael spots something on what's left of a shelf — half-melted but intact. A small plastic case. Looks like nothing. A contact lens holder.

**Kael knows what it is.**

Marcus wore glasses — big frames, didn't care how they looked. Kael wears contacts. Years ago, Kael gave Marcus a data key shaped like a contact lens case — "contacts would suit you better, make you look less like someone's grandfather." Marcus kept it. Used it.

The case IS the key. Press it with thumb pressure, NFC clicks on, tap to access. In 2147, everything's remote — your data lives in the cloud, and your key is how you access it from anywhere.

Marcus's whole life. His work. His investigation. All accessible with that key.

Kael grabs it. Pockets it.

One of the contractors sees him take something.

"HE'S GOT IT. STOP HIM."

### Scene 8: The Chase (Apartment Block)

Kael runs. Not out to the streets — through the building.

The contractors pursue. The apartment block is a maze:
- Hallways that turn and dead-end
- Stairwells, some blocked by fire damage
- Other residents' doors — some open, people startled, shouting

Kael knows how to move. Twenty years in tight spaces on stations and ships. He's faster in the corridors than they are.

He's losing them. Almost clear.

He stops. Listens. Nothing. "I think I've lost them."

He puts his headphones back on. The brown noise returns — safety, cocoon. He keeps moving.

Turns a corner at full sprint, looking back over his shoulder—

---

## ACT THREE: THE COLLISION

### Scene 9: The Accident

**COLLISION.**

He didn't hear her coming. The headphones.

Kael's shoulder connects hard with someone's face. A woman. She goes down.

He stumbles, catches himself, keeps moving for three more steps before he stops.

Looks back. She's on the ground, not moving.

It's dark in this part of the hallway — emergency lighting only, half the fixtures burned out. He can barely see her.

He listens. The contractors — are they still behind him?

Silence. He lost them. For now.

He goes back to her. Drags her into a doorway alcove, out of sight. Can't leave her in the open — if they find her, they'll ask what she saw.

He crouches. Checks if she's breathing. She is. Just knocked out cold.

Her face. Hard to see in the dark. Something familiar about it.

He pulls out his comm for light—

### Scene 10: The Crackdown

Kael hides. Catches his breath. The contractors have called it in.

Now he hears it: **Sirens. Boots. Shouting.**

Not just the contractors. Paramilitary cops. A full sweep.

They're going door to door. Not just looking for him — they're cracking down on the whole block.

Through a window, Kael sees:
- An old man dragged from his apartment
- A family pushed into the street, kids crying
- Doors kicked in, homes ransacked
- Anyone who resists gets beaten

This isn't about finding Kael. This is about sending a message. *This is what happens when someone runs.*

Kael watches, sick. This is the Earth he left. This is what it became.

### Scene 11: The Reveal

The crackdown continues outside. Kael stays hidden in the alcove with the unconscious woman.

He pulls out his comm. Uses the light to see her face.

And freezes.

**Marcus's face.** But not. Softer. Female. But the same bone structure. The same eyes, closed now.

**Elara Oyelaran.**

Marcus's twin sister.

She must have been coming here too. Maybe five minutes behind him. Saw the contractors go in, hung back, waited for them to leave. Then came up anyway.

And Kael ran straight into her.

### Scene 12: End of Episode

Kael stares at her. The sirens. The shouting. The building being torn apart around them.

He's holding Marcus's data key. He's crouched over Marcus's sister, who he just accidentally knocked out cold.

This is not how any of this was supposed to go.

**Elara stirs.**

Her eyes flutter. She's trying to get her bearings. Disoriented. Head probably pounding.

She focuses. Sees a man crouched over her. A stranger. In the dark.

Her mouth opens—

**About to scream—**

**CUT TO BLACK.**

**END EPISODE 1.**

## WHAT THIS EPISODE ESTABLISHES

1. **Kael is competent** — He can fight, evade, survive
2. **The world is brutal** — Paramilitary contractors, crackdowns, collateral damage
3. **Marcus left something behind** — His data key (access to everything)
4. **Elara exists** — And Kael just made the worst possible first impression
5. **Stakes are immediate** — People are being hurt because of him

---

## THE DATA KEY

**World-building note:** In 2147, all data is remote. Your files, your work, your life — it's all in the cloud. What you carry is just a key to access it. Like a YubiKey, but everyone has one, disguised as something mundane.

Marcus's key is a **contact-lens-case-shaped data key**:
- Marcus wore glasses — big frames, didn't care how they looked. Kael wears contacts.
- Kael gave Marcus the key years ago, teasing him: "contacts would suit you better"
- Marcus kept it. Used it. A small personal detail that connects them.
- Press with thumb pressure, NFC clicks on, tap to access
- Looks like nothing — the contractors almost missed it
- Contains access to Marcus's entire digital life: his work, his investigation, everything

The contractors were looking for this. Now Kael has it. And they know.

This becomes the throughline: what did Marcus find? It's all on that key.

## EPISODE 1 TONE

**Not slow-burn.** This episode moves.

- Cold open: emotional setup, the turn
- Act One: arrival, sensory assault, tension builds
- Act Two: action — firefight, chase
- Act Three: consequences — crackdown, collision, reveal

The episode should feel like: *holy shit, what did I just watch, I need Episode 2 immediately.*

---

## CLIFFHANGER

Elara's eyes opening. She doesn't know who Kael is. He just knocked her out. The cops are tearing the neighborhood apart.

**How do they get out of this?**

*End Episode 1*
