## KEY CREATIVE DECISIONS LOCKED THIS SESSION

### The Data Key
- **Marcus wore glasses** — big frames, didn't care how they looked
- **Kael wears contacts**
- Years ago, Kael gave Marcus a **contact-lens-case-shaped data key** as a joke ("contacts would suit you better, make you look less like someone's grandfather")
- Marcus kept it. Used it.
- **The case IS the key** — press with thumb pressure, NFC clicks on, tap to access
- Contains access to Marcus's entire digital life, his investigation, everything

### Noise-Cancelling Headphones
- Kael uses them to cope with Earth's sensory assault
- Plays **brown noise** — sounds like The Liminal's systems, like home
- Takes them off when things look shady (approaching the fire-damaged apartment)
- Puts them back on when he thinks he's clear ("I think I've lost them")
- **This is why he doesn't hear Elara** — collision happens because headphones are on

### Marcus's Backstory (via flashback)
- Can't leave Earth: "Federal auditing doesn't exactly transfer to the belt colonies. All I know is spreadsheets and fraud patterns."
- Supporting parents: "Dad's latest scheme fell apart. Again. Someone's gotta help Mom keep the lights on."
- To Kael: "Not all of us are as free as you."
- Ties into hustling culture theme — Marcus's dad is a failed hustler

### Earth Sensory Details
- **No holographic ads** — keeping it grounded, not too sci-fi
- Audio assault instead: speakers on corners, music bleeding from storefronts, podcasts, ads
- Two specific audio pieces before Kael puts headphones on:
  1. Political podcast: "the moderates are the real extremists, because they enable—"
  2. TrustVer ad: "They said I could trust them! Don't make my mistake. TrustVer—because in a world of deep fakes, you deserve to know what's real."
- People bumping into each other while staring at screens (foreshadows Elara collision)

### Vanessa Locke
- Appears as backdrop in Episode 1 (news story Kael scrolls past)
- May return later in the series — noted for future development

- Phase 0.3: Narrative architecture (8-episode limited series)
- Episode 1 screenplay (complete, ends on cliffhanger)

---

## TONE REMINDERS

- **Exhausted clarity** — Johnny Silverhand meets Agent Smith
- Not Mr. Robot bleakness, not nihilism
- Kael sees through the bullshit but doesn't preach
- Government is incompetent, not evil
- The conspiracy is systemic — investors funding both sides, profiting from division
- Theme: "Connected but not loving" → "Someone has to"

---

## SERIES OVERVIEW

8-episode limited series. Key beats:
- Ep 1: The Return — Kael discovers Marcus is dead, goes to Earth, firefight, meets Elara (collision)
- Ep 4: Midpoint revelation — same money funds both sides, it's systemic
- Ep 6: All is lost — everything collapses
- Ep 7-8: Kael chooses to bear witness, activates Marcus's dead man's switch, confronts The Investors
