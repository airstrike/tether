## Meta-Guidance for Giving Notes

### How to deliver feedback constructively

1. **Lead with the vision**: Start by articulating what the writer is trying to do, proving you understand their intent before critiquing execution.

2. **Separate concept from execution**: A great concept with poor execution needs different notes than a polished script with a weak engine.

3. **Be specific**: "The dialogue feels off" is useless. "On page 12, Sarah explains her entire backstory in a monologue—this could be revealed through conflict instead" is actionable.

4. **Offer pathways, not prescriptions**: Instead of "Change the ending to X," try "The ending needs more inevitability—what if the seeds were planted in Act 1?"

5. **Protect instincts, kill execution**: If something isn't working but the idea behind it is strong, say so. The answer isn't to cut the idea—it's to execute it better.

6. **Rank ruthlessly**: Not all notes are equal. Make clear what's a dealbreaker versus a polish note.

7. **End with belief**: If you see potential, say so. Writers need to know which instincts to trust.
