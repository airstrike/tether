# TETHER
### A Narrative Space Game
#### Pitch Bible v0.1

---

## LOGLINE

A misanthropic loner returns to Earth after twenty years in space to investigate the death of his only friend — and is dragged into a conspiracy that forces him to become the reluctant savior of a humanity he abandoned.

---

## TONE & TOUCHSTONES

- **Cowboy Bebop** — Melancholy cool. A drifter with a past.
- **Andor** — Ordinary person pulled into something bigger through small choices.
- **Blade Runner** — A society that's advanced but spiritually hollow.
- **Half-Life** — Combat serves story, not the other way around.
- **Disco Elysium** — Narrative-first. Choices that reveal character.

Pixel art. Synth score with jazz undertones. Long silences. Rain on neon. The hum of a ship that feels more like home than any planet.

---

## PREMISE

**KAEL VASARO**, mid-40s, has spent two decades alone in space. Courier work. Salvage. Whatever keeps him moving. He left Earth not in anger but in exhaustion — a lifetime of emotional absence taught him that connection wasn't for him. His parents were there but never present. He moved through schools, cities, countries. Space was just the next step.

He's not running anymore. He built a life in the silence. The ship — **THE LIMINAL** — is home. He's content.

Then something reminds him of **MARCUS** — the one friend. They never met in person. Online. Text. The only intimacy he could tolerate. He looks him up.

He's dead. Suicide, officially.

But something's wrong. Records too clean. Questions no one's asking. He goes back to find out what happened.

What he finds is bigger than one death.

## THE WORLD

**2147.** Earth didn't collapse. It *optimized*.

Social media replaced human interaction entirely. Relationships are metrics. Attention is currency. Corporations and a handful of trillionaire kingmakers control politics through "innovation funds" that pick winners and losers. Politicians lie openly because truth is just another content stream, and outrage performs better.

Everyone is connected. No one is loved.

Space is the margin — stations, moon colonies, asteroid belts. Out there, things are rougher but more honest. Transactions are clear. People leave you alone.

Kael's returning to a world that became everything he ran from.

## CHARACTER BREAKDOWN

### KAEL VASARO — The Protagonist

The player character. Dry. Guarded. Not cruel, just closed. He's not a badass with a heart of gold — he's a man who decided long ago that caring costs too much. His arc isn't "learning to love humanity." It's discovering that detachment is its own kind of complicity. He becomes a hero not out of hope but out of grim obligation. *Someone has to.*

### MARCUS OYELARAN (deceased) — The Friend

Government auditor. Federal Accounts Division — the kind of job that sounds important but is actually just spreadsheets and compliance reports. He took the job because it was stable, because it paid well enough, and because he had no better ideas. Wicked smart. Could have done anything. Wasn't interested in anything.

His parents were terrible with money — always one crisis away from disaster. So Marcus became the responsible one. Supported them quietly, never complained, never expected thanks. It was just what you do. Another obligation in a life full of obligations and empty of purpose.

He and Kael found each other online — probably some niche forum, late nights, the kind of conversation that only happens between people who've stopped pretending. Two guys going through the motions. Two guys who understood that the other one wasn't okay and didn't need to talk about it. They never met in person. Didn't need to.

Marcus didn't go looking for the conspiracy. He just noticed something in the numbers. Discrepancies. Patterns. And because he had no career ambition to protect, no political instincts telling him to look away, he kept pulling the thread.

That's what got him killed.

We meet Marcus through records, messages, people who knew him. He left breadcrumbs — maybe intentionally, maybe just because he knew Kael would eventually come looking.

### THE LIMINAL — The Ship

A character in its own right. Twenty years of modifications, routines, wear patterns. The player should feel its familiarity. Leaving it feels like leaving safety.

### SUPPORTING CAST

Introduced through acts. A fixer who knew Marcus. A corporate whistleblower. A true believer in a resistance Kael finds naive. An old spacer who remembers when Earth meant something. Each represents a different response to the world's decay.

---

## THEMATIC CORE

**Connected but not loving.**

The world optimized for engagement and lost the ability to be present. Kael is the extreme expression of that — he opted out entirely. But opting out didn't save him. It just made him a witness.

The question the game asks: *When you've given up on people, what's left that's still worth protecting?*

The answer, for Kael: *The people who didn't give up on you.*

---

## STRUCTURE

### Act I — THE RETURN

Kael learns of Marcus's death. Returns to Earth for the first time in 20 years. Culture shock. Investigation begins. He's just trying to understand what happened, then leave.

Key beats:
- The inciting reminder (what makes him look Marcus up?)
- Landing on Earth — the sensory overload, the alienation
- First threads: Marcus's apartment, his work, the official story that doesn't add up
- The first breadcrumb that says *this was not suicide*

### Act II — THE DESCENT

The conspiracy reveals itself in layers. Marcus was onto something systemic — money flowing where it shouldn't, entities that don't exist on paper, a rot at the center of how Earth actually runs. Kael gets entangled — debts, enemies, people who need him. He can't extract cleanly. The reluctant hero phase.

Key beats:
- Following the money (Marcus's investigation, reconstructed)
- The first real danger — someone notices Kael asking questions
- Allies who complicate things (people with agendas, people who believe in things)
- The scope expands: this isn't just corruption, it's something worse
- Point of no return: Kael can't walk away without betraying Marcus twice

### Act III — THE COST

Full scope revealed. The threat isn't just political — it's existential. The system Marcus uncovered isn't just corrupt, it's designed to consolidate control in a way that ends any meaningful human autonomy. Kael has to choose: disappear again, or become something he never wanted to be.

He chooses the latter. Not because he believes. Because someone has to.

Key beats:
- The revelation (what Marcus actually found)
- Kael's lowest point — the temptation to just leave
- The decision to stay
- The final action — not a battle, but a choice with consequences
- Ending: Tragic but purposeful. He wins, but doesn't walk away clean. The world doesn't transform. But it survives. And somewhere, a crack formed in him. Not hope. Just... the memory of why hope once mattered to someone he loved.

## GAMEPLAY PILLARS

### 1. Narrative & Choice
Dialogue-driven. Choices aren't good/evil but open/closed. How much does Kael let in? Does he stay transactional or does something slip through?

### 2. Exploration
The Liminal in space (backstory, freedom, safety). Earth's megacities (claustrophobia, noise, density). The contrast *is* the mood.

### 3. Trading & Information
Economic loop that also serves investigation. Traders hear things. Cargo has stories. Money leaves trails.

### 4. Light Combat
Stakes and consequence. Someone doesn't want him digging. Not skill-focused — tension-focused. Violence should feel costly, not fun.

## WHY THIS GAME

Because the feeling is real.

The disconnection. The exhaustion with pervasive cynicism and performance. The creeping sense that something essential is being optimized out of human experience. The friendships that exist entirely in text, between people who've never shared a room but understand each other better than anyone nearby.

This game doesn't preach. It doesn't offer easy answers. It asks what's left when you've given up — and whether that's enough to act anyway.

---

## OPEN QUESTIONS

- What exactly did Marcus find? (The conspiracy's specifics)
- What reminds Kael of Marcus after 20 years?
- Does Kael survive the ending?
- What does "winning" look like in a world this broken?
